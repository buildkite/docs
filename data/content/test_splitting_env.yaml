predefined:
  - name: BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID
    desc:
      - The UUID of the pipeline build. The Test Engine Client uses this UUID along with `BUILDKITE_STEP_ID` to uniquely identify the test plan.
  - name: BUILDKITE_JOB_ID
    desc:
      - The UUID of the job in the pipeline's build.
  - name: BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION_SLUG
    desc:
      - The slug of your Buildkite organization.
  - name: BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB
    desc:
      - The index number of a parallel job created from a parallel build step.
      - Ensure you configure `parallelism` in your pipeline definition. Learn more about parallel build steps in [Concurrency and parallelism](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/controlling-concurrency#concurrency-and-parallelism).
  - name: BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB_COUNT
    desc:
      - The total number of parallel jobs created from a parallel build step.
      - Ensure you configure `parallelism` in your pipeline definition. Learn more about parallel build steps in [Concurrency and parallelism](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/controlling-concurrency#concurrency-and-parallelism).
  - name: BUILDKITE_STEP_ID
    desc:
      - The UUID of the step group in the pipeline build. The Test Engine Client uses this UUID along with `BUILDKITE_BUILD_ID` to uniquely identify the test plan.

mandatory:
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_API_ACCESS_TOKEN
    desc:
      - Buildkite API access token with `read_suites`, `read_test_plan`, and `write_test_plan` scopes. You can create an [API access token](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens) from **Personal Settings** > **API Access Tokens** in the Buildkite interface. To avoid this token being tied to any one employee or person, ideally, the token should be created for a bot user account within your Buildkite organization.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RESULT_PATH
    desc:
      - The path to store the test result. The Test Engine Client uses this environment variable to tell the runner where to store the test result. The Test Engine Client reads the test result after each test run for retries and verification.
      - For RSpec, the result is generated using the `--format json` and `--out` CLI options, while for Jest, it is generated using the `--json` and `--outputFile` options. We have included these options in the default test command for RSpec and Jest. If you need to customize your test command, make sure to append the CLI options to save the result to a file.
      - Please refer to the `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_CMD` environment variable for more details.
    note:
      - The Test Engine Client will not delete the file after running the test, however it will be deleted by Buildkite Agent as part of the build lifecycle.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_RUNNER
    desc:
      - The test runner to use for running tests. Currently `rspec`, `jest`, `cypress`, `playwright`, `pytest`, `pytest-pants`, `gotest`, and `cucumber` are supported.
  - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_SUITE_SLUG
    desc:
      - The slug of your Test Engine test suite. You can find the suite slug in the url for your test suite.
      - "For example, the slug for the url: `https://buildkite.com/organizations/my-organization/analytics/suites/my-suite` is `my-suite`."

optional:
  rspec:
    - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_DEBUG_ENABLED
      default: false
      desc:
        - A flag to enable more verbose logging.
    - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RETRY_CMD
      desc:
        - The command to retry the failed tests. The Test Engine Client will replace the `{{testExamples}}` placeholder with the failed tests. If not set, the client will use the same command defined in `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_CMD`.
    - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RETRY_COUNT
      default: 0
      desc:
        - The number of retries. The Test Engine Client runs the test command defined in `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_CMD` and retries only the failed tests up to `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RETRY_COUNT` times, using the retry command defined in `BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_RETRY_CMD`.
    - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_SPLIT_BY_EXAMPLE
      default: false
      desc:
        - A flag to enable split by example. When this option is `true`, the Test Engine Client will split the execution of slow test files over multiple partitions.
    - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_CMD
      default: bundle exec rspec --format progress --format json --out {{resultPath}} {{testExamples}}
      desc:
        - The test command to run your tests. The Test Engine Client will replace the `{{testExamples}}` placeholder with the test plan.
      note:
        - It is necessary to include `--format json --out {{resultPath}}` in the test command, because the Test Engine Client needs to read the result after each test run.

    - name: BUILDKITE_TEST_ENGINE_TEST_FILE_EXCLUDE_PATTERN
