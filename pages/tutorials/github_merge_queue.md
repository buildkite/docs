# Using GitHub merge queues

>ðŸš§ GitHub beta feature
> The merge queue feature for pull requests is in public beta and subject to change.

Merge queues are a feature of GitHub to improve development velocity on busy branches. They can increase the rate at which pull requests are merged into a branch while ensuring all the required branch protection checks pass. Merge queues preserve the order of pull requests to merge, remove redundant builds, and reduce flaky merges.


## Before you start

Familiarize yourself with [managing a merge queue in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue).

## Enable a merge queue for a pipeline

The merge queue creates temporary branches with a special prefix to validate pull request changes. You need to update the pipeline configuration to match branches with the special prefix. To avoid these temporary branches triggering multiple builds on the same pipeline for the same commit, we recommend enabling the option to skip builds on existing commits.

To enable a merge queue for a pipeline:

1. From your Buildkite dashboard, select your pipeline.
1. Select _Pipeline Settings_ > _GitHub_.
1. In the _GitHub Settings_ section, select the _Skip builds with existing commits_ checkbox.

If you have existing branch limiting rules:

1. From your Buildkite dashboard, select your pipeline.
1. Select _Pipeline Settings_ > _GitHub_.
1. In the _Branch Limiting_ section, add a filter for the following pattern:

    ```text
    gh-readonly-queue/{base_branch}/*
    ```

That's it! Your pipeline supports merge queues in GitHub. ðŸŽ‰
