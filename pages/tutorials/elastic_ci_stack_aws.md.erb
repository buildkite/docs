# Elastic CI Stack for AWS

The [Elastic CI Stack for AWS](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws) gives you a private, autoscaling Buildkite Agent cluster in your own AWS account. This guide leads you through getting started with the stack :cloudformation::tada:

## Launching the stack

Go to the [Agents page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/agents) on Buildkite and select the _AWS_ tab:

<%= image "agents-tab.png", size: "#{1532/2}x#{296/2}", alt: "Buildkite AWS Agents" %>

Click _Launch Stack_ :red_button:

<%= image "agents-tab-launch.png", size: "#{554/2}x#{316/2}", alt: 'Launch Buildkite Elastic CI Stack' %>

<%= image "aws-select-template.png", size: "#{1037/2}x#{673/2}", alt: "AWS Select Template Screen" %>

After clicking _Next_, configure the stack using your Buildkite agent token:

<%= image "aws-parameters.png", size: "#{1019/2}x#{392/2}", alt: "AWS Parameters" %>

If you don't know your agent token, there is a _Reveal Agent Token_ button available on the right-hand side of the [Agents page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/agents):

<%= image "buildkite-agent-token.png", size: "#{752/2}x#{424/2}", alt: "Reveal Agent Token" %>

By default the stack uses a job queue of `default`, but you can specify any other queue name you like. See the [Buildkite Agent Job Queue docs](/docs/agent/v3/queues) for more info.

Review the parameters, see [Elastic CI Stack for AWS Parameters](/docs/agent/v3/elastic_ci_aws/parameters) for more details.

Once you're ready, check both checkboxes:

- I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.
- I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Then click _Create stack_:

<%= image "aws-create-stack.png", size: "#{1257/2}x#{455/2}", alt: "AWS Create Stack Button" %>

After creating the stack, Buildkite takes you to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home). Click the _Refresh_ icon in the top right hand corner of the screen until you see the stack status is `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

You now have a working Elastic CI Stack ready to run builds! :tada:

## Running your first build

We’ve created a sample [bash-parallel-example sample pipeline](https://github.com/buildkite/bash-parallel-example) for you to test with your new autoscaling stack. Click the _Add to Buildkite_ button below (or on the [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/buildkite/bash-parallel-example)):

<a class="inline-block" href="https://buildkite.com/new?template=https://github.com/buildkite/bash-parallel-example" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://buildkite.com/button.svg" alt="Add Bash Example to Buildkite" class="no-decoration" width="160" height="30"></a>

Click _Create Pipeline_. Depending on your organization's settings, the next step will vary slightly: 

- If your organization uses the web-based steps editor (default), your pipeline is now ready for its first build. You can skip to the next step.
- If your organization has been upgraded to the [YAML steps editor](https://buildkite.com/docs/tutorials/pipeline-upgrade), you should see a _Choose a Starting Point_ wizard. Select _Pipeline Upload_ from the list:
    <%= image "buildkite-pipeline-upload.png", size: "#{782/2}x#{400/2}", alt: 'Upload Pipeline from Version Control' %>

Click _New Build_ in the top right and choose a build message (perhaps a little party `\:partyparrot\:`?):

<%= image "buildkite-new-build.png", size: "#{1140/2}x#{898/2}", alt: 'Triggering Buildkite Build' %>

Once your build is created, head back to [AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2autoscaling/home) to watch the Elastic CI Stack creating new EC2 instances:

<%= image "ec2-asg.png", size: "#{400/2}x#{200/2}", alt: 'AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group Menu' %>

<!-- vale off -->

Select the _buildkite-AgentAutoScaleGroup-xxxxxxxxxxxx_ group and then the _Instances_ tab. You'll see instances starting up to run your new build and after a few minutes they'll transition from _Pending_ to _InService_:

<!-- vale on -->

<%= image "buildkite-demo-instances.png", width: 3266/2, height: 1748/2, alt: "AWS Auto Scaling Group Launching" %>

Once the instances are ready they will appear on your Buildkite Agents page:

<%= image "buildkite-connected-agents.png", size: "#{1584/2}x#{1508/2}", alt: 'Buildkite Connected Agents' %>

And then your build will start running on your new agents:

<%= image "build.png", size: "#{2356/2}x#{1488/2}", alt: "Your First Build" %>

Congratulations on running your first Elastic CI Stack build on Buildkite! :clap::tada:
