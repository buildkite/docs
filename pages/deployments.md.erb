# Deployments with Buildkite

- overview of deploys
- different ways to deploy: single step, separate pipeline

<%= toc %>



## Deploy patterns

- there are two ways we recommend for setting up your project for deployments
- you can add a single step to your existing pipeline that handles deploys, or you can create a separate pipeline that handles the deployment
- these two options are suited for different scenarios

### Single deploy step

- good for basic deployments/ ones that don't have many steps
- can add a wait and a command step to the end of your existing pipeline

### Deploy pipeline

- good for complex deploys/ones that require multiple steps to complete

## Tools

- useful plugins for deployments (docker, ecs?)
- if there's no plugin for your service/platform, add one!
