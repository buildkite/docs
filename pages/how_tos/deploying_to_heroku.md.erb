# Deploying to Heroku

It’s easy to test and deploy [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) applications from your Buildkite pipelines.

For GitHub based pipelines you can use Heroku’s [Automatic Deploys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) feature to have a branch deployed once Buildkite has marked the commit as having passed. To get started with automatic deploys: enable it in your Heroku dashboard, check “Wait for CI to pass before deploy”, and when Heroku sees the passing Buildkite commit status it will automatically perform a slug deploy. You can also auto-deploy pull requests using [Review Apps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps).

If you don’t use GitHub or need more control of deployments, this guide will run you through the steps required for performing a manual deployment using `git push`. You can also use these methods to create pipelines for `heroku` cli tasks you'd like to automate.

## Setting up the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)

<%= estimated_time "5-8 minutes" %>

You can deploy to Heroku using the same `git push` command you’d run from your development machine.

First step is installing the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line) on your Buildkite agent machine. For example, this is how you’d do it on a linux agent machine:

```bash
$ wget -O- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
```

You can find OSX and Windows installers [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line#download-and-install).

And now verify it installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
$ heroku --version
```

You should see version numbers for both the `heroku-toolbelt` and `heroku-cli` packages. 

The next step is to login using the CLI and your Heroku credentials. We recommend creating a new user in Heroku just for this machine (a “machine user”). Creating a machine user in Heroku is simple: sign up to Heroku as a new user and then add that user as a collaborator to your existing Heroku application.

If you’re ready to login with the Heroku user credentials, make sure you’re running as your buildkite-agent user (which for most packages is “buildkite-agent”) and then run the heroku login command:

```bash
$ sudo su buildkite-agent
$ heroku login
```

You’re now ready to run `heroku` commands in your Buildkite pipelines! :tada:

## Setting up your build pipeline

In your pipeline setup, add a command step. Limit it to the branch you want to deploy, and have it run the following command:

```bash
heroku git:remote --app my-app
git push heroku "$BUILDKITE_COMMIT":master
```

It should look like this:

<%= image "steps.png", size: '726x378', alt: 'Buildkite pipeline heroku deploy step' %>

What’s happening here? `heroku git:remote` ensures the Git `remote` is always pointing to the correct Heroku application and doesn’t have an old value from previous builds. The `git push` specifies the exact commit, to make sure we’re pushing the commit we’ve just tested.

## Running a build

Once you’ve saved the pipeline settings the final step is to push a commit to master and watch it automatically deploy to Heroku:

<%= image "deploy-success.png", size: '726x691', alt: 'Buildkite Heroku deploy success' %>

## Post-deploy scripts

If you want to run post-deploy tasks on Heroku simply a waiter and another command step, for example:

```bash
heroku git:remote --app my-app
heroku run echo "A post-deploy command"
```
