# Plugins Directory

The [plugins directory](https://buildkite.com/plugins) is where you can both discover and publish Buildkite plugins. Visit the directory at https://buildkite.com/plugins

Plugins supported by the Buildkite team display the Buildkite logo in the directory, and can be found in the [Buildkite Plugins GitHub Organization](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins).

## Adding your plugin

To have your plugin appear in the directory:

1. Host your plugin on GitHub as a public repository.
1. Ensure your repository contains a valid `plugin.yml` file containing at least the `name` and `description` fields.
1. Add the `buildkite-plugin` [GitHub repository topic](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics).
1. Wait up to 1 hour for the plugins directory to sync with GitHub, and for your plugin to appear.

For example:

<%= image "github-topic.png", width: 1214/2, height: 440/2, alt: "Screenshot of the ECR plugin GitHub repo with the Buildkite-plugin topic highlighted by a red box" %>

Once completed, your plugin will display in the directory as pictured below:

> If you've completed the above steps and your plugin doesn't appear, send an email to <a href="mailto:support@buildkite.com">support@buildkite.com</a> and we'll investigate it for you.
