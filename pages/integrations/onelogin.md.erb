# SSO with OneLogin

OneLogin can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for both OneLogin and Buildkite.

### Step 1. Add Buildkite in OneLogin

Log into your OneLogin account, and follow these steps:

1. In the 'Apps' tab of your OneLogin organization's Admin area, select the 'Add App' button to search the OneLogin directory
1. Search for 'Buildkite'
1. Add the Buildkite app to your OneLogin account
2. Click on the 'Configuration' tab of your new Buildkite application
3. Enter your Buildkite organization slug
4. Click the 'Save' button in the top right to save your configuration

### Step 2. Email Buildkite Support

Send an email to support@buildkite.com with the following 5 fields:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Domain name</td>
        <td>
          The domain you use with OneLogin for which you want to enable SSO. This must match one of the emails you have verified with your Buildkite account.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Organization slug</td>
        <td>
          The Buildkite organization for which you want to enable SSO.  
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The following three fields can be found in the 'SSO' tab on the Buildkite app page in OneLogin: 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)</td>
        <td>
            The URL where you can log in to OneLogin's SAML service.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Issuer URL</td>
        <td>
            The URL that identifies your OneLogin service. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>X.509 certificate</td>
        <td>
            The public key certificate generated for you by OneLogin. You'll need the whole file, not just a link to the file. 
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

When we receive your email, Buildkite support will set up SSO in test mode and reply with instructions for performing a test login.

### Step 3. Perform a Test Login

Follow the instructions sent by Buildkite support to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly, before it is activated for all your organization members.

### Step 4. Buildkite Support will Activate SSO

Once you've performed a test login, reply to the previous email and Buildkite support will activate SSO via OneLogin for your entire Buildkite organization. Activating SSO will log out all of your organization’s members, to ensure that all data access is authorized through OneLogin.
