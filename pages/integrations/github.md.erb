# GitHub

Buildkite can connect to a GitHub repository in your GitHub account or GitHub organization and use the [Commit Status API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#statuses) to update the status of commits in pull requests.

To complete this integration, you need admin privileges for your GitHub repository.

## Connecting Buildkite and GitHub

You can use the [Buildkite app for GitHub](#connect-your-buildkite-account-to-github-using-the-github-app) to connect a Buildkite organization to a GitHub organization.

>ðŸ“˜ Benefits of using the GitHub App
> Using GitHub App removes the reliance on individual user connections to report build statuses. See the <a href="https://buildkite.com/changelog/102-github-app-integration">changelog announcement</a>

If you want to [connect using OAuth](#connect-your-buildkite-account-to-github-using-oauth) you can still do so from your _Personal Settings_.

## Connect your Buildkite account to GitHub using the GitHub App

Connecting Buildkite and GitHub using the GitHub App lets your GitHub organization admins see permissions and manage access on a per-repository basis.

>ðŸ“˜ Required permissions for adding a provider
> The user adding the provider needs to be a Buildkite user connected to a GitHub user who has administrative privileges on both Buildkite and the GitHub organizations.

1. Open your Buildkite organization's _Settings_.
1. Select _[Repository Providers](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/repository-providers)_ > _GitHub_.
    <%= image "repository-providers.png", width: 2338/2, height: 1600/2, alt: "Screenshot of the Buildkite Repository Providers" %>
1. Select _Connect to a new GitHub Account_. If you have never connected your Buildkite and GitHub accounts before, you will first need to select _Connect_ and authorize Buildkite.
1. Select the GitHub organization you want to connect to your Buildkite organization.
1. Choose which repositories Buildkite should have access to, then select _Install_.

You can now [set up a pipeline](#set-up-a-new-pipeline-for-a-github-repository).

## Buildkite GitHub permissions

When you connect your GitHub organization, Buildkite needs the following permissions:

* Read access to metadata: this is a default permission for all GitHub apps. From the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/permissions-required-for-github-apps#metadata-permissions):

    > GitHub Apps have the Read-only metadata permission by default. The metadata permission provides access to a collection of read-only endpoints with metadata for various resources. These endpoints do not leak sensitive private repository information.
* Read and write access to checks, commit statuses, deployments, pull requests, and repository hooks: this is needed for Buildkite to perform tasks such as running a build on pull requests and reporting that build status directly on the PR on GitHub.

## Set up a new pipeline for a GitHub repository

1. Select _Pipelines_ > _New Pipeline_ <svg viewBox="0 0 22 22" width="22px" height="22px" style="fill: currentcolor; vertical-align: middle;border-radius:50%;"><title>New Pipeline</title><rect x="4" y="10" width="14" height="2"></rect>
<rect x="10" y="4" width="2" height="14"></rect>
</svg>
2. Enter your pipeline details, including your GitHub repository URL in the form `git@github.com:your/repo`.

    <%= image "new-pipeline.png", width: 1550/2, height: 846/2, alt: "Screenshot of adding a new pipeline " %>

3. If you are still using the web steps visual editor, add at least one step to your pipeline. Refer to [Defining Steps - Adding steps](/docs/pipelines/defining_steps#adding-steps) for more information.
4. Select _Create Pipeline_.
4. Follow the onscreen instructions to set up a webhook:

    1. Add a new webhook in GitHub.
    2. Paste in the provided webhook URL.
    3. Select which events trigger the webhook.

    The repository webhook is required so that the Buildkite GitHub app does not need read access to your repository.
5. If using the YAML steps editor, add at least one step to your pipeline, then select _Save and Build_. Refer to [Defining Steps - Adding steps](/docs/pipelines/defining_steps#adding-steps) for more information.

If you need to set up the webhook again, you can find the instructions linked at the bottom of the pipeline GitHub settings page.

You can edit your pipeline configuration at any time in _Pipeline Settings_.

## Branch configuration and settings

<%= render_markdown partial: 'integrations/branch_config_settings' %>

## Running builds on pull requests

To run builds for GitHub pull requests, edit the GitHub settings for your Buildkite pipeline and choose the _Build Pull Requests_ checkbox.

Optionally, select one or more of the following:

* _Limit pull request branches_
* _Skip pull request builds for existing commits_
* _Rebuild pull requests when they become ready for review_
* _Build pull requests from third-party forked repositories_. Make sure to check the [managing secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) guide if you choose to do this.

If you want to run builds only on pull requests, set the _Branch Filter Pattern_ in the pipeline to a branch name that will never occur (such as "this-branch-will-never-occur"). Pull request builds ignore the _Branch Filter Pattern_, and all pushes to other branches that don't match the pattern are ignored.

## Running builds on git tags

Builds are only run for tags when a [`push` event is triggered](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#push). To enable builds for `push` events for git tags, edit the _GitHub settings_ for your Buildkite pipeline, and choose the _Build Tags_ checkbox.


Before triggering builds for git tags from the [API](/docs/apis/rest-api/builds#create-a-build) or a [scheduled build](/docs/pipelines/scheduled-builds), make sure your agent is configured to fetch git tags: `BUILDKITE_GIT_FETCH_FLAGS="-v --prune --tags"`.

## Noreply email handling

When you [connect your GitHub account to Buildkite](#connecting-buildkite-and-github) the email address associated with the GitHub account is added to your Buildkite account. If you've got GitHub set not to display your email, `[username]@users.noreply.github.com` or the more recent `[username+id]@users.noreply.github.com` is added instead. The email address of a commit is one of the ways Buildkite matches webhook builds to users.

## Customizing commit statuses

The commit status is the label used to identify the Buildkite checks on your commits and pull requests on GitHub. Normally, Buildkite autogenerates these statuses.

For example, if you select _Update commit statuses_ in your _Pipeline Settings_:

<%= image "update-commit-statuses-on.png", alt: "Screenshot of GitHub build settings with Update commit statuses enabled" %>

Your checks will appear on your pull request as _buildkite/`<pipeline-name>`_:

<%= image "github-default-status.png", alt: "Screenshot of the resulting GitHub pull request statuses" %>


You can customize the commit statuses, for example to reuse the same pipeline for multiple components in a monorepo, at both the build and step level, using the [`notify`](/docs/pipelines/notifications) attribute in your `pipeline.yml`.

### Build level

1. Add the following to your `pipeline.yml`, at the top level:

    ```yaml
    notify:
        - github_commit_status:
            context: "my-custom-status"
    ```
2. In _Pipeline Settings_ > _GitHub_, make sure _Update commit statuses_ is not selected. Note that this prevents Buildkite from automatically creating and sending statuses for this pipeline, meaning you will have to handle all commit statuses through the `pipeline.yml`.
3. When you make a new commit or pull request, you should see _my-custom-status_ as the commit status:
    <%= image "github-custom-status.png", alt: "Screenshot of GitHub build settings and the resulting GitHub pull request statuses" %>

In a setup for a repository containing one codebase and one `pipeline.yml`, this customizes the commit status for the pipeline. However, if you have multiple `pipeline.yml` files in one repo, feeding in to the same Buildkite pipeline, this allows you to have different statuses when building different sections of the repo.

For example, if you have a monorepo containing three applications, you could use the same pipeline, with different `pipeline.yml` files for each application. Each `pipeline.yml` can contain a different GitHub status.

### Step level

1. Add `notify` to a command in your `pipeline.yml`:

    ```yaml
    steps:
    - label: "Example Script"
        command: "script.sh"
        notify:
          - github_commit_status:
              context: "my-custom-status"
    ```
2. In _Pipeline Settings_ > _GitHub_, you can choose to either:
    - Make sure _Update commit statuses_ is not selected. Note that this prevents Buildkite from automatically creating and sending statuses for this pipeline, meaning you will have to handle all commit statuses through the `pipeline.yml`.
    - Enable both _Update commit statuses_ and _Create a status for each job_. Buildkite sends its default statuses as well as your custom status.
3. When you make a new commit or pull request, you should see _my-custom-status_ as the commit status:
    <%= image "github-custom-status.png", alt: "Screenshot of GitHub build settings and the resulting GitHub pull request statuses" %>
