# OAuth with Google G Suite

Google's G Suite (previously Google Apps) can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for Buildkite.

### Step 1. Email Buildkite Support 

Send an email to support@buildkite.com with the following information:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Domain name</td>
            <td>
              The domain you use with Google G Suite for which you want to enable OAuth. This must match one of the emails you have verified with your Buildkite account.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Organization slug</td>
            <td>
              The Buildkite organization for which you want to enable OAuth.  
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

When we receive your email, Buildkite support will set up SSO in test mode and reply with instructions for performing a test login.

### Step 3. Perform a Test Login

Follow the instructions sent by Buildkite support to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly, before it is activated for all your organization members.

### Step 4. Buildkite Support will Activate SSO

Once you've performed a test login, reply to the previous email and Buildkite support will activate SSO via Google for your entire Buildkite organization. Activating SSO will log out all of your organization’s members, to ensure that all data access is authorized through Google.
