## Using one repository in multiple pipelines and organizations

If you want to use the same repository in multiple pipelines (including pipelines in different Buildkite organizations), you need to configure a separate webhook for each pipeline. Follow the webhook setup instructions in the Buildkite UI. Buildkite shows you these instructions when you create the pipeline, but you can also find them in _Pipeline Settings_ > _`<Provider>`_ > _`<Provider>` Setup Instructions_.
