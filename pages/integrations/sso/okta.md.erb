# Single Sign-On with Okta

To add Okta as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization, you need admin privileges for both Okta and Buildkite.

To set up Single Sign-On, follow the [SAML configuration guide](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Buildkite.html).

## Using SCIM to manage users

<div class="Docs__note">
  <p>This integration with Okta is currently available only to a limited number of customers. Contact support@buildkite.com to learn more.</p>

### Supported SCIM Features

* Create Users (note that users added to Okta won't be billed for until they have signed up with Buildkite)
* Deactivate Users (Deprovisioning)

### Configuration instructions

Using the SCIM provisioning settings in Okta you can automatically remove user accounts from your Buildkite organization. In Okta this feature is called 'Deactivating' a user. You need an enabled Okta SSO Provider before you can set up SCIM.

After creating your SSO Provider in Buildkite, you will need the  _Base URL_ and _API Token_ from your Okta SSO Provider Settings:
