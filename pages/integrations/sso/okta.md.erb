# Single Sign-On with Okta

To add Okta as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization, you need admin privileges for both Okta and Buildkite.

## Setting up SSO with SAML

To set up single sign-on, follow the [SAML configuration guide](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Buildkite.html).

## Using SCIM to provision and manage users

Customers on the Buildkite [Enterprise](https://buildkite.com/pricing) plan can optionally enable automatic deprovisioning for their Buildkite users.

### Supported SCIM features

* Create users
* Deactivate users (deprovisioning)

>ðŸ“˜
> Buildkite does not bill you for users that you add to your Okta Buildkite app until they sign in to your Buildkite organization.

### Configuration instructions

Using the SCIM provisioning settings in Okta, Buildkite customers on the [Enterprise](https://buildkite.com/pricing) plan can automatically remove user accounts from your Buildkite organization. In Okta this feature is called 'Deactivating' a user. You need an enabled Okta SSO Provider before you can set up SCIM.

>ðŸ“˜
> User deprovisioning is an Enterprise only feature that needs to be enabled. Please contact support at support@buildkite.com to have this enabled.

After creating your SSO Provider in Buildkite, you will need the  _Base URL_ and _API Token_ from your Okta SSO Provider Settings:

Go to your Buildkite application in Okta to set up deprovisioning:

1. On the _Sign On_ tab in the Okta Buildkite application, edit the _Credential Details_ settings, select _Email_ for the _Application username format_ and press _Save_.
1. On the _Provisioning_ tab, select _Integration_ from the left side menu.
1. Click _Configure API Integration_.
1. Tick _Enable API integration_ and enter the URL and API token copied from your Buildkite SSO Provider settings.
1. Click _Test API Credentials_ and then _Save_ once successfully verified.
1. Select _To App_ from the left side menu.
1. Edit the _Provisioning to App_ settings, and enable _Create Users_ and _Deactivate Users_.
1. Save and test your settings.

### Provisioning existing users

Existing Okta users aren't automatically provisioned in Buildkite; you'll need to sync your users in order to deprovision them.

This can be done one of two ways:

1. Removing and re-assigning the users and groups to the Okta Buildkite app, or
1. If your Okta tenant has [Lifecycle Management] enabled, then you can use the _Provision User_ function on the _Assignments_ tab of the Okta Buildkite app
