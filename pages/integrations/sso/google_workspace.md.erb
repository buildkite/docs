# Single Sign-On with Google Workspace

Google Workspace (previously G Suite and Google Apps) can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for Buildkite.

## Step 1. Create an SSO provider

In your Buildkite Organization Settings' _Single Sign On_ menu item, choose the Google G Suite provider:

>ðŸ“˜ You can also set up SSO providers manually with GraphQL.
> See the <a href="/docs/integrations/sso/sso-setup-with-graphql">SSO Setup with GraphQL Guide</a> for detailed instructions and code samples.

## Step 2. Perform a test login

Follow the instructions to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly before you activate it for your organization members.

## Step 3. Enable the new SSO provider

Once you've performed a test login you can enable your provider. Activating SSO will not force a log out of existing users, but will cause all new or expired sessions to authorize through G Suite before organization data can be accessed.

If you need to edit or update your G Suite provider settings at any time, you will need to disable the provider first. For more information on disabling a provider, see the [disabling SSO](/docs/integrations/sso#disabling-and-removing-sso) section of the SSO overview.
