## Branch configuration and settings

You can edit the version control provider settings for each pipeline from the pipelineâ€™s settings page. Go to _Pipelines_ > _Pipeline Menu_ > _Pipeline Settings_ > _`<Provider>`_.

If you need more control over your pipeline configuration, add a [pipeline.yml](/docs/pipelines/defining-steps#adding-steps) to your repository. Then you can use [conditionals](/docs/pipelines/conditionals) and [branch filtering](/docs/pipelines/branch-configuration) to configure your pipeline.
