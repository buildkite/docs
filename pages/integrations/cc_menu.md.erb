# CCMenu & CCTray

Buildkite has support for the `cctray.xml` format, allowing you to feed your build status updates into desktop tools such as CCMenu, or to create build dashboards to show the status of your builds and branches.

## Feed URL

You can access your organization’s `cc.xml` feed using the URL:

```
https://cc.buildkite.com/[organization-slug].xml?access_token=xxx
```

You’ll need to <a href="<%= url_helpers.user_access_tokens_url %>" rel="nofollow">create an API Access Token</a> with scope `read_builds`.

## Filtering by pipeline

If you want to scope to a single pipeline, add the pipeline slug to the end of the URL:

```
https://cc.buildkite.com/[organization-slug]/[pipeline-slug].xml?access_token=xxx
```

For example, if your pipeline's URL is `https://buildkite.com/acme-co/my-proj`
then your feed URL would be
`https://cc.buildkite.com/acme-co/my-proj.xml?access_token=xxx`

## Filtering by branch

If you want to scope the builds to a particular branch, add `&branch=[branch-name]` to the end of the URL. This works for organization and pipeline feeds.

For example, the following URL will provide build status updates for only the `master` branch of a pipeline:

```
https://cc.buildkite.com/[organization-slug]/[pipeline-slug].xml?branch=master&access_token=xxx
```
