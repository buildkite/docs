Note that in this case, no signal was sent to the process, it simply never started.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong><code>SIGNATURE_REJECTED</code></strong></p><p>The agent refused the job because the signature could not be verified.

This could be due to a misconfiguration of the job, or due to a lack of resources.</p></td></tr>
