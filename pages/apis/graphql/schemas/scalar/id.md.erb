<p>Represents a unique identifier that is Base64 obfuscated. It is often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as <code>&quot;VXNlci0xMA==&quot;</code>) or integer (such as <code>4</code>) input value will be accepted as an ID.</p>
