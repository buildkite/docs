# REST API Overview

The Buildkite REST API aims to give you complete programmatic access and control of Buildkite to extend, integrate and automate anything to suit your particular needs.

The current version of the Buildkite API is v2.

For the list of existing disparities between the REST API and the GraphQL API, see [API Differences](/docs/apis/api-differences).

## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.buildkite.com` domain. All data is sent as JSON.

```bash
curl https://api.buildkite.com
```

```json
{
  "response": "Hello World"
}
```

## Query string parameters

Some API endpoints accept query string parameters which are added to the end of the URL. For example, the [builds listing APIs](/docs/api/builds#list-all-builds) can be filtered by `state` using the following `curl` command:

```
curl "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/my-org/pipelines/my-pipeline/builds?state=passed"
```

## Request body properties

Some API requests accept JSON request bodies for specifying data. For example, the [build create API](/docs/api/builds#create-a-build) can be passed the required properties using the following `curl` command:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/my-org/pipelines/my-pipeline/builds" \
  -d '{
    "key": "value"
  }'
```

The data encoding is assumed to be `application/json`. Unless explicitly stated you can not encode properties as `www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

## Authentication

You can authenticate with the Buildkite API using access tokens.

API access tokens allow to call the API without using your username and password. They can be created on your <a href="<%= url_helpers.user_access_tokens_url %>" rel="nofollow">API Access Tokens</a> page, limited to individual organizations and permissions, and revoked at any time from the web interface [or the REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api/access-token#revoke-the-current-token).

To authenticate using a token, set the <code>Authorization</code> HTTP header to the word <code>Bearer</code>, followed by a space, followed by the access token. For example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.buildkite.com/v2/user
```

>ðŸš§ Basic authentication
> Access using basicÂ HTTP authentication is no longer available.

## Pagination

For endpoints which support pagination, the pagination information can be found in the `Link` HTTP response header containing zero or more of `next`, `prev`, `first` and `last`.

```bash
curl -i "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/my-great-org/pipelines/my-pipeline/builds"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Link: <https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/my-great-org/pipelines/my-pipeline/builds?api_key=f8582f070276d764ce3dd4c6d57be92574dccf86&page=3>; rel="next", <https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/my-great-org/pipelines/my-pipeline/builds?api_key=f8582f070276d764ce3dd4c6d57be92574dccf86&page=6>; rel="last"
```

You can set the page using the following query string parameters:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr><th><code>page</code></th><td>The page of results to return<p class="Docs__api-param-eg"><em>Default:</em> <code>1</code></p></td></tr>
  <tr><th><code>per_page</code></th><td>How many results to return per-page<p class="Docs__api-param-eg"><em>Default:</em> <code>30</code></p><p class="Docs__api-param-eg"><em>Maximum:</em> <code>100</code></p></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## CORS headers

API responses include the following [CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) allowing you to use the API directly from theÂ browser:

* `Access-Controller-Allow-Origin: *`
* `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Link`

For an example of this in use, see the [Emojis API example on CodePen](http://codepen.io/toolmantim/pen/xbQRaL) for adding emoji support to your own browser-based dashboards and build screens.

## Migrating from v1 to v2

The following changes were made in v2 of our API:

* <code>POST /v1/organizations/{org.slug}/agents</code> has been removed
* <code>DELETE /v1/organizations/{org.slug}/agents/{id}</code> has been removed
* All project-related properties in JSON responses and requests have been renamed to pipeline
* The <code>featured_build</code> pipeline property has been removed
* The deprecated <code>/accounts</code> URL has been removed
* URLs containing <code>/projects</code> have been renamed to <code>/pipelines</code>
