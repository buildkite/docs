# Writing Build Scripts

Steps in your build pipelines are most often just shell scripts that are checked in alongside your code. The [Buildkite Agent](/docs/agent) will run your scripts, capture and report the log output, and use the exit status to mark the build as passed or failed.

## Configuring Bash

There are four Bash options which are often used in build scripts:

<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th><code>-e</code></th>
    <td>Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><code>-u</code></th>
    <td>Exit immediately if an undefined variable is used (e.g. <code>echo "$UNDEFINED_ENV_VAR"</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><code>-o pipefail</code></th>
    <td>Ensures pipelines (e.g. <code>cmd | othercmd</code>) return a non-zero status if a command fails</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><code>-x</code></th>
    <td>Print each expanded command before executing (useful for debugging)</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Most build scripts should set the `-e` and `-o pipefail` options to ensure if any command fails your entire build script fails. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -eo pipefail

run_my_tests
```

If you need to perform tasks after your main command executes then `set -e` might not be suitable, as any failure will cause the script to immediately exit and subsequent commands to be skipped. Instead of using `set -e` you’ll need to [capture the exit status](#capturing-exit-status) of your command yourself.

## Debugging your environment

The first step to debugging script is to output the environment. This will show any [environment variables set up by the Buildkite Agent](/docs/guides/environment-variables), as well as other important environment variables such as `$PATH`.

To add the environment to your build output simply execute `env` at the start of your build script.

```
#!/bin/bash

env
```

You can also set the `-x` option which will print out each command, fully expanded, before executing it.

```
#!/bin/bash

set -x
```

## Collapsing Build Output

You can group your build output by echoing `--- group name` in your build output.

```bash
echo "--- build group here"
```

If you want to have the group open by default, use `+++` instead of `---`:

```bash
echo "+++ build group here"
```

You can even include colors and emojis!

```bash
echo -e "--- Running \033[33mspecs\033[0m \:cow:\:bell:"
```

<%= image("collapsing_example.png", size: '261x127', alt: 'Screenshot of colored, emoji build output') %>

## Capturing Exit Status

If you want to execute commands after your main command, but still report success/fail correctly, you’ll need to capture the exit status of your main command and then exit with it at the end.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

run_my_tests

# Capture the exit status of the last command in a variable
ORIGINAL_STATUS=$?

# Additional commands

# Finish with the original status
exit $ORIGINAL_STATUS
```

## Managing Log Output Size

See the [Managing Log Output guide](/docs/guides/managing-log-output) for techniques on reducing large build output.
