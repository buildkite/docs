# Collecting data from other test frameworks

You can integrate any language and framework by uploading [Test Analytics JSON](/docs/test-analytics/importing-json) or [JUnit XML](/docs/test-analytics/importing-junit-xml) after your tests run. You can also [build your own collector](/docs/test-analytics/your-own-collectors).
