# Generate and store SLSA provenance

Supply-chain levels for software artifacts ([SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/) and pronounced like "salsa") is an industry-consensus specification for describing and gradually improving artifact supply chain security.

When using Buildkite [Pipelines](/docs/pipelines) with [Package Registries](/docs/package-registries), you can publish software packages and artifacts to registries with [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance) in only four steps.

This guide uses the following Buildkite examples to demonstrate this process:

- Buildkite organization: `nova-corp`
- Pipeline: `ruby-logger-gem`, which builds a RubyGem package
- Registry: `ruby-gems` to store the RubyGem

Although this guide uses RubyGems as examples, this process will work for [all supported package ecosystems](/docs/package-registries/ecosystems) (with the exception of OCI-based packages like [OCI (Docker)](/docs/package-registries/ecosystems/oci) and [Helm OCI](/docs/package-registries/ecosystems/helm-oci)).

## Step 1: Configure steps to generate SLSA provenance

The [Generate Provenance Attestation Buildkite Plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/generate-provenance-attestation-buildkite-plugin) generates a SLSA provenance attestation for artifacts that have been uploaded to artifact storage in a pipeline step.

First, configure a step step that builds a RubyGem gem and uploads it to artifact storage.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Build Gem"
    command: "gem build logger.gemspec"
    artifact_paths: "logger-*.gem"
```

A SLSA provenance attestation can be generated by adding this plugin to your pipeline step that builds the package or artifact:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Build Gem"
    command: "gem build logger.gemspec"
    artifact_paths: "logger-*.gem"
    plugins:
      - generate-provenance-attestation#v1.1.0:
          artifacts: "logger-*.gem"
          attestation_name: "gem-attestation.json"
```

In the example above, a SLSA provenance attestation will be generated for artifacts matching `logger-*.gem` and be uploaded it to artifact storage as `gem-attestation.json`.

<%= image "artifacts-attestation.png", alt: "Screenshot of artifacts showing the attestation generated by the Generate Provenance Attestation Buildkite Plugin.", class: "no-decoration" %>

Once this step is complete, `gem-attestation.json` will be available to subsequent steps in the pipeline.

See [an example of a SLSA provenance statement](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/generate-provenance-attestation-buildkite-plugin/blob/d9f2ff4d6b745f17cc55b6b91778a0e1a7d45824/examples/statement.json) that this plugin generates. This SLSA provenance statement is then serialized and uploaded as [a dead simple signing envelope (DSSE)](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/generate-provenance-attestation-buildkite-plugin/blob/d9f2ff4d6b745f17cc55b6b91778a0e1a7d45824/examples/envelope.json). This `envelope.json` DSSE file shows an example of the `gem-attestation.json` file format. Learn more about DSSE in [DSSE Envelope](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse/blob/master/envelope.md).

## Step 2: Configure steps to publish a package with SLSA provenance

The [Publish to Packages](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/publish-to-packages-buildkite-plugin/) plugin allows you to quickly and easily publish a package to Package Registries. When the `attestations: ` attribute is set, the package will be published from artifact storage with the specified attestations.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Publish Gem"
    plugins:
      - publish-to-packages#v2.2.0:
          artifacts: "logger-*.gem"
          registry: "nova-corp/ruby-gems"
          attestations:
            - "gem-attestation.json"
```

In the example above, artifacts matching `logger-*.gem` will be published to `nova-corp/ruby-gems` Package Registry. Additionally, they will be published with the `gem-attestation.json` attestation.

## Step 3: Define an OIDC policy for the registry

The Publish to Packages plugin authenticates with Package Registries using an [Agent OIDC token](/docs/agent/v3/cli-oidc). Therefore, an [OIDC policy](/docs/package-registries/security/oidc#define-an-oidc-policy-for-a-registry) must be configured on the [Ruby registry](/docs/package-registries/ecosystems/ruby).

```yaml
- iss: "https://agent.buildkite.com"
  claims:
    organization_slug: "nova-corp"
    pipeline_slug: "ruby-logger-gem"
```

{: codeblock-file="OIDC policy for nova-corp/ruby-gems registry"}

In the example above, the policy allows the Buildkite pipeline with slug `ruby-logger-gem`, configured in the Nova Corp Buildkite organization (with slug `nova-corp`) to publish packages to the Ruby registry named **ruby-gems**.

## Step 4: Complete the pipeline

All the steps above come together in a simple pipeline that builds and publishes a Ruby Gem with SLSA Provenance. A [step dependency](/docs/pipelines/configure/dependencies#defining-explicit-dependencies) ensures that the **Publish Gem** step does not start until the **Build Gem** step has finished successfully.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Build Gem"
    key: "build-gem"
    command: "gem build logger.gemspec"
    artifact_paths: "logger-*.gem"
    plugins:
      - generate-provenance-attestation#v1.1.0:
          artifacts: "logger-*.gem"
          attestation_name: "gem-attestation.json"

  - label: "Publish Gem"
    depends_on: "build-gem"
    plugins:
      - publish-to-packages#v2.2.0:
          artifacts: "logger-*.gem"
          registry: "nova-corp/ruby-gems"
          attestations:
            - "gem-attestation.json"
```

{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

This generates a build that looks something like this:

<%= image "full-pipeline-build.png", alt: "Screenshot of Artifacts showing the attestation generated by the Generate Provenance Attestation plugin.", class: "no-decoration" %>

The SLSA provenance will then be visible under the **Attestations** tab of a package details page.

<%= image "provenance-in-packages.png", alt: "Screenshot of Artifacts showing the attestation generated by the Generate Provenance Attestation plugin.", class: "no-decoration" %>

## Summary

- SLSA Provenance can be generated and stored in Buildkite with the help of [Generate Provenance Attestation](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/generate-provenance-attestation-buildkite-plugin) and [Publish to Packages](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/publish-to-packages-buildkite-plugin/) plugins.

- Artifacts that are built and published in this way satisfy [SLSA Build Level 1](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l1) requirements.
