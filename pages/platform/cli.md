# The Buildkite CLI

The Buildkite CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting directly with the Buildkite platform itself. This tool provides command line/terminal access to work with a subset of the Buildkite platform's features, as you normally would through its web interface.

Using the Buildkite CLI, you can manage Buildkite Agents and their configuration, work with a Buildkite pipeline's builds, control job execution, and manipulate its artifacts, along with several other actions.

## Installation

The Buildkite CLI can be installed on all major platforms. Learn more about how to install the tool on your platform in [Buildkite CLI installation](/docs/platform/cli/installation).

## Usage

Once you've installed the Buildkite CLI, you can start using it by typing `bk`, followed by its specific command at your command-line prompt. To learn more about the `bk` command's own comprehensive set of command categories, see the [Command-line reference](/docs/platform/cli/reference).

## Configuration

The Buildkite CLI requires an API access token to interact with Buildkite and your Buildkite organizations. Learn more about how to configure these API access tokens in [Buildkite CLI configuration](/docs/platform/cli/configuration).
