# Command-line reference overview

The Buildkite CLI (`bk`) allows you to interact with the Buildkite platform through the command line. The comprehensive set of `bk` commands, organized by category, lets you manage Buildkite Agents and their configuration, work with a Buildkite pipeline's builds, control job execution, and manipulate its artifacts. These commands can be essential for managing your build infrastructure, automating tasks, and troubleshooting issues.
