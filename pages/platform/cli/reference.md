# Command-line reference overview

The [Buildkite CLI](/docs/platform/cli) (`bk`) allows you to interact with the Buildkite platform through the command line. The comprehensive set of `bk` commands, along with categories of sub-commands, lets you manage Buildkite Agents and their configuration, work with a Buildkite pipeline's builds, control job execution, and manipulate its artifacts. These command sets can be essential for managing your build infrastructure, automating tasks, and troubleshooting issues.
