# Ruby Collectors

Test Analytics ships with Ruby collectors :github: [`test-collectors-ruby`](https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-ruby).

You can also upload test results by importing [JSON](/docs/test-analytics/importing-json) or [JUnit XML](/docs/test-analytics/importing-junit-xml).

## RSpec collector

[RSpec](https://rspec.info/) is a behaviour-driven development library for Ruby.
If you're already using RSpec for your tests, add the `buildkite-test_collector` gem to your code to collect your test results into your Test Analytics dashboard.

Before you start, make sure RSpec runs with access to [CI environment variables](/docs/test-analytics/ci-environments).

1. Create a new branch:

    ```
    git checkout -b install-buildkite-test-analytics
    ```

2. Add `buildkite-test_collector` to your `Gemfile` in the `:test` group:

    ```rb
    group :test do
      gem "buildkite-test_collector"
    end
    ```

3. Run `bundle` to install the gem and update your `Gemfile.lock`:

    ```sh
    bundle
    ```

3. Add the Test Analytics code to your application in `spec/spec_helper.rb`, and set the BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN [securely](/docs/pipelines/secrets) on your agent or agents.

    ```rb
    require "buildkite/test_collector"

    Buildkite::TestCollector.configure(hook: :rspec)
    ```

4. Commit and push your changes:

    ```sh
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Install and set up Buildkite Test Analytics"
    $ git push
    ```

Once you're done, in your Test Analytics dashboard, you'll see analytics of test executions on all branches that include this code.

If you don't see branch names, build numbers, or commit hashes in the Test Analytics UI, then see [CI Environments](/docs/test-analytics/ci-environments) to learn more about exporting your environment to the collector.

## minitest collector

[minitest](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

If you're already using minitest for your tests, add the `buildkite-test_collector` gem to your code to collect your test results into your Test Analytics dashboard.

1. Create a new branch:

    ```
    git checkout -b install-buildkite-collector
    ```

2. Add `buildkite-test_collector` to your `Gemfile` in the `:test` group:

    ```rb
    group :test do
      gem "buildkite-test_collector"
    end
    ```

3. Run `bundle` to install the gem and update your `Gemfile.lock`:

    ```sh
    bundle
    ```

3. Add the Test Analytics code to your application in `test/test_helper.rb`, and set the BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN [securely](/docs/pipelines/secrets) on your agent or agents.

    ```rb
    require "buildkite/test_collector"

    Buildkite::TestCollector.configure(hook: :minitest)
    ```

4. Commit and push your changes:

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Install and set up Buildkite Test Analytics"
    git push
    ```

Once you're done, in your Test Analytics dashboard, you'll see analytics of test executions on all branches that include this code.

If you don't see branch names, build numbers, or commit hashes in the Test Analytics UI, then see [CI Environments](/docs/test-analytics/ci-environments) to learn more about exporting your environment to the minitest collector.

## Troubleshooting `allow_any_instance_of` errors

If you're using RSpec and seeing errors related to `allow_any_instance_of`, which look like this:

```ruby
Failure/Error: allow_any_instance_of(Object).to receive(:sleep)
       Using `any_instance` to stub a method (sleep) that has been defined on a prepended module (Buildkite::TestCollector::Object::CustomObjectSleep) is not supported.
```

you can fix them by being more specifc in your stubbing, which is [better practice](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/v/3-11/docs/working-with-legacy-code/any-instance), by replacing `allow_any_instance_of(Object).to receive(:sleep)` with `allow_any_instance_of(TheClassUnderTest).to receive(:sleep)`.
