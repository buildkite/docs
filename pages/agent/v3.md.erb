# Buildkite Agent (v3)

The buildkite agent is a small, reliable and cross-platform build runner that makes it easy to run automated builds on your own infrastructure. Its main responsibilities are polling buildkite.com for work, running build jobs, reporting back the status code and output log of the job, and uploading the job's artifacts.

## How it Works

The agent works by polling Buildkite’s agent API over HTTPS. There is no need to forward ports or provide incoming firewall access, and the agents can be run across any number of machines and networks.

The agent starts by registering itself with Buildkite, and once registered it’s placed into your organization’s agents pool. The agent periodically polls Buildkite looking for new work, waiting to accept an available job.

After accepting a build job the agent will execute the command, streaming back the build script’s output and then posting the final exit status.

Whilst the job is running you can use the `buildkite-agent meta-data` command to set and get build-wide meta-data, and `buildkite-agent artifact` for fetching and retrieving binary build-wide artifacts. These two commands allow you to have completely isolated build jobs (similar to a 12 factor web application) but have easy access to shared state and data storage across any number of machines and networks.

## Installation

The agent can be easily installed onto almost any system large or tiny, and we have installers to make it easy to run and manage your agents. See the [installation instructions](v3/installation) to get started.

## Usage

```bash
$ buildkite-agent --help
Usage:

  buildkite-agent <command> [arguments...]

Available commands are:

  start      Starts a Buildkite agent
  annotate   Annotate the build page within the Buildkite UI with text from within a Buildkite job
  artifact   Upload/download artifacts from Buildkite jobs
  meta-data  Get/set data from Buildkite jobs
  pipeline   Make changes to the pipeline of the currently running build
  bootstrap  Run a Buildkite job locally
  help       Shows a list of commands or help for one command

Use "buildkite-agent <command> --help" for more information about a command.
```

To start an agent you’ll need your organization’s agent token from the Agents page of your Buildkite dashboard. You pass the token to the agent via an environment variable or command line flag, and it will register itself with Buildkite and wait to accept jobs.

## Configuration

The agent has a standard configuration file format on all systems to set meta-data, priority, etc. See the [configuration documentation](configuration) for more details.

## Customisation

The agent’s behaviour can be customized using either [Hooks](v3/hooks) or [Plugins](v3/plugins). Hooks are scripts that are run during the lifecycle of a build. You can use these if you want to customize behaviour on the agent. Plugins use the same lifecycle hooks as [Hooks](v3/hooks), but are defined in your Pipeline YAML File, so you can customize your build behaviour easily between different pipelines in a portable way.
