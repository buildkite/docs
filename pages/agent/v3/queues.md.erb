# Buildkite Agent Job Queues

Each pipeline has the ability to separate jobs using queues. This allows you isolate a set of jobs and/or agents, making sure they only run jobs that are intended to be assigned to them.

Common use cases for queues include deployment agents, and pools of agents for specific pipelines or teams.

## The default queue

All agents include an extra default [meta-data tag](agent-meta-data) of `queue=default`.

For example, the following empty query pattern matches the 6 agents running the `default` queue:

<%= image 'agent-selector-2.png', size: '553x353', alt: 'Agent Selector showing all but the deploy selected' %>

## Setting an agent’s queue

An agent’s queue is configured in the [agent’s meta-data](agent-meta-data), either using the command line flag, an environment variable, or the config file.

## Targeting a queue

Just as you would target agents using normal [agent meta-data](agent-meta-data), you can target specific queues using `queue=name` in your build pipeline query rules.

For example, the following build step matches only agents running the `deploy` queue (and ignores the agents running the `default` queue):

<%= image 'agent-selector.png', size: '553x353', alt: 'Agent Selector showing only the deploy selected' %>
