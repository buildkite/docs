# Buildkite Agent Prioritization

By setting an Agent’s priority value you determine when it gets assigned build jobs compared to other Agents.
Agents with a higher value priority number are assigned work first, with the last priority being given to Agents with the default value of `null`.

To set an Agent’s priority you can set it in the configuration file:

```
priority=9
```

or with the `--priority` command line flag:

```
buildkite-agent start --priority 9
```

or with the `BUILDKITE_AGENT_PRIORITY` an environment variable:

```
env BUILDKITE_AGENT_PRIORITY=9 buildkite-agent start
```

## Load balancing

You can use the Agent priority value to load balance jobs across machines running multiple Agents.

For example if you have 2 machines with 3 Agents on each machine, you would set one Agent on each machine to `priority=3`, one on each to `priority=2`, and one on each to `priority=1`.

Buildkite will then automatically load balance the jobs across machines, as it will assign jobs to the high priority agents first.
