Usage:

   buildkite-agent pipeline upload <file> [arguments...]

Description:

   Allows you to change the pipeline of a running build by uploading either a
   YAML (recommended) or JSON configuration file. If no configuration file is
   provided, the command looks for the file in the following locations:

   - buildkite.yml
   - buildkite.yaml
   - buildkite.json
   - .buildkite/pipeline.yml
   - .buildkite/pipeline.yaml
   - .buildkite/pipeline.json

   You can also pipe build pipelines to the command allowing you to create
   scripts that generate dynamic pipelines.

Example:

   $ buildkite-agent pipeline upload
   $ buildkite-agent pipeline upload my-custom-pipeline.yml
   $ ./script/dynamic_step_generator | buildkite-agent pipeline upload

Options:

   --replace                   Replace the rest of the existing pipeline with the steps uploaded. Jobs that are already running are not removed. [$BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_REPLACE]
   --job value                 The job that is making the changes to it's build [$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID]
   --dry-run                   Rather than uploading the pipeline, it will be echoed to stdout [$BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_UPLOAD_DRY_RUN]
   --no-interpolation          Skip variable interpolation the pipeline when uploaded [$BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_NO_INTERPOLATION]
   --agent-access-token value  The access token used to identify the agent [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN]
   --endpoint value            The Agent API endpoint (default: "https://agent.buildkite.com/v3") [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ENDPOINT]
   --no-http2                  Disable HTTP2 when communicating with the Agent API. [$BUILDKITE_NO_HTTP2]
   --debug-http                Enable HTTP debug mode, which dumps all request and response bodies to the log [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG_HTTP]
   --no-color                  Don't show colors in logging [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_NO_COLOR]
   --debug                     Enable debug mode [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG]
