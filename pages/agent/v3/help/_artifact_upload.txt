Usage:

   buildkite-agent artifact upload <pattern> <destination> [arguments...]

Description:

   Uploads files to a job as artifacts.

   You need to ensure that the paths are surrounded by quotes otherwise the
   built-in shell path globbing will provide the files, which is currently not
   supported.

Example:

   $ buildkite-agent artifact upload "log/**/*.log"

   You can also upload directly to Amazon S3 if you'd like to host your own artifacts:

   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyy
   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1 # default is us-east-1
   $ export BUILDKITE_S3_ACL=private # default is public-read
   $ buildkite-agent artifact upload "log/**/*.log" s3://name-of-your-s3-bucket/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID

   Or upload directly to Google Cloud Storage:

   $ export BUILDKITE_GS_ACL=private
   $ buildkite-agent artifact upload "log/**/*.log" gs://name-of-your-gs-bucket/$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID

Options:

   --job value                 Which job should the artifacts be uploaded to [$BUILDKITE_JOB_ID]
   --content-type value        A specific Content-Type to set for the artifacts (otherwise detected) [$BUILDKITE_ARTIFACT_CONTENT_TYPE]
   --agent-access-token value  The access token used to identify the agent [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN]
   --endpoint value            The Agent API endpoint (default: "https://agent.buildkite.com/v3") [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_ENDPOINT]
   --no-http2                  Disable HTTP2 when communicating with the Agent API. [$BUILDKITE_NO_HTTP2]
   --debug-http                Enable HTTP debug mode, which dumps all request and response bodies to the log [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG_HTTP]
   --no-color                  Don't show colors in logging [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_NO_COLOR]
   --debug                     Enable debug mode [$BUILDKITE_AGENT_DEBUG]
