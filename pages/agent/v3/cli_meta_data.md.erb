# buildkite-agent meta-data

The Buildkite Agent’s `meta-data` command provides your build pipeline with a powerful key/value data-store that works across build steps and build agents, no matter the machine or network.

See the [Using Build Meta-data](/docs/pipelines/build-meta-data) guide for a step-by-step example.

## Setting data

Use this command in your build scripts to save string data in the Buildkite meta-data store.

Meta-data values are restricted to a maximum of 100 kilobytes. Keys and values larger than 1 kilobyte are discouraged. Please use [artifacts](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact) for large data which needs to uploaded and downloaded.
