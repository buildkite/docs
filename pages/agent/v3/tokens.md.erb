# Agent Tokens

The Buildkite Agent requires an agent token to connect to Buildkite and register for work. If you are an admin of your Buildkite organization, you can view the tokens on your [Agents page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/agents).

## The default token

When you create a new organization in Buildkite, a default agent token (agent registration token) is created. This token is used to start an agent, and it can be used for testing and development.  They cannot be used with the artifacts or meta-data. It's recommended to [create new, specific tokens](#creating-tokens) for each new environment.

Agent registration tokens are not exposed within the job environment.

## Agent access token

Agent access tokens (agent session tokens) are created when an agent is registered with Buildkite, and are unique for every registered agent.

Agent access token only works as long as the agent that created it is running, and is used by all agent operations once the agent is [started](/docs/agent/v3/cli-start).

Access tokens are exposed within the job environment.

## Exchanging tokens

Agent registration token (default token) can be exchanged for an agent session token without any additional checks. To do it, the agent needs to call the `https://agent.buildkite.com/v3/register` endpoint with its registration token in the authorization header. The API response to this query is a regular agent access token that is next ingested and used by the agent.

## Using and storing tokens

The token is used by the Buildkite Agent's [start](/docs/agent/v3/cli-start#starting-an-agent) command, and can be provided on the command line, set in the [configuration file](/docs/agent/v3/configuration), or provided using the [environment variable](/docs/pipelines/environment-variables) `BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN`.

It's recommended you use your platform's secret storage (such as the [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html)) to allow for easier rollover and management of your agent tokens.

## Creating tokens

New tokens can be created using the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql-api) with the `agentTokenCreate` mutation.

For example:

```graphql
mutation {
  agentTokenCreate(input: {
    organizationID: "organization-id",
    description: "A description"
  }) {
    agentTokenEdge {
      node {
        id
        token
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can find your `organization-id` in your Buildkite organization settings page, or by running the following GrapqQL query:

```graphql
query GetOrgID {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    id
  }
}
```

<!--alex ignore clearly-->

The token description should clearly identify the environment the token is intended to be used for, and is shown on your [Agents page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/agents) (for example, `Read-only token for static site generator`).

It is possible to create multiple agent tokens using the GraphQL API. These tokens will show up on the [Agents page](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/agents) in the UI, but can only be managed (created or revoked) using the API.

## Revoking tokens

Tokens can be revoked using the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql-api) with the `agentTokenRevoke ` mutation.

You need to pass your agent token as the ID in the mutation. You can get the token from your Buildkite dashboard, in _Agents_ > _Reveal Agent Token_, or you can retrieve a list of agent token IDs using this query:

```graphql
query GetAgentTokenID {
  organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
    agentTokens(first:50) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          uuid
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, using the token ID, revoke the agent token:

```graphql
mutation {
  agentTokenRevoke(input: {
    id: "token-id",
    reason: "A reason"
  }) {
    agentToken {
      description
      revokedAt
      revokedReason
    }
  }
}
```

Once a token is revoked, no new agents will be able to start with that token. Revoking a token does not affect any connected agents.

## Scope of access

Agent tokens are specific to each Buildkite organization, and can be used to register an agent with any [queue](/docs/agent/v3/queues). Agent tokens can not be shared between organizations.

Agent tokens define the access permissions (`read` and/or `write`) for actions to be performed on all jobs and pipelines. This is necessary as Buildkite agents can run for extended periods of time. An agent might get launched to service one pipeline and then pick up work for another one after. This means that the access tokens for agents need the access to all pipelines and jobs.

## Log security considerations

Agent access token can allow writing to the stdout of a job as job log streaming happens on the `https://agent.buildkite.com/v3/jobs/chunks` agent API endpoint authenticated by the agent access token. If a bad actor gains access to your agent access token, they would be able to falsify new logs, but they wouldn’t be able to remove any existing logs as the endpoint is append-only.

## Session tokens

During registration, the agent exchanges the agent token for a session token. The session token is exposed to the job as the [environment variable](/docs/pipelines/environment-variables) `BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and is used by the [annotate](/docs/agent/v3/cli-annotate), [artifact](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact), [meta-data](/docs/agent/v3/cli-meta-data), and [pipeline](/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline) commands. Session tokens are scoped to a specific agent, and are valid for the duration the agent is connected.
