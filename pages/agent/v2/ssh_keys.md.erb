# Buildkite Agent SSH Keys

If your agent needs to clone your repositories using git and SSH, you'll need to configure your agent with a valid SSH key.

<%= toc %>

## Finding your SSH key directory

When the Buildkite Agent runs any git operations, SSH will look for keys in `~/.ssh` under whichever user the agent runs as. Each platform’s [agent installation documentation](/docs/agent/installation) specifies the exact location of this directory.

## Debugging SSH key issues

To help debug SSH issues you can enable verbose logging by editing the `~/.ssh/config` file and adding the following settings:

```
Host *
  LogLevel DEBUG3
```

## Creating a single SSH key

The following shows an example of creating a new “machine user” SSH key for an agent:

```bash
$ sudo su buildkite-agent # or whichever user your agent runs as
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "dev+build@myorg.com"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
4b:6f:7b:5f:8e:f7:5b:c1:fa:e3:dd:9a:8e:a8:e8:33 dev@org.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|              .  |
|        S      o |
|       . o    . .|
|        . o  .  o|
|      E. . o...*=|
|     .oo..o..oB*O|
+-----------------+
$ ls
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
$ cat id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDELESv1QGfoZ2hECJr.......Yho9hDPoNefDbcdZM4NdKWTVmyNGQo6YTzw== dev+build@myorg.com
```

You'd then add this key to the user’s settings on [GitHub](/docs/agent/github-ssh-keys), BitBucket, Gitlab, etc.

## Creating multiple SSH keys

If you need to use multiple SSH keys for different pipelines, we support a special repository hostname format which you can use with your `~/.ssh/config`.

To use a different key for a given pipeline, first change the repository hostname in your Buildkite pipeline settings from `server.com` to `server.com-mypipeline`, and then add an entry to the SSH config file on your agent machine for the host `server.com-mypipeline` and specify your custom SSH key.

For example, if you had a pipeline repository URL of `git@github.com:org/pipeline-1.git` you would change it in your Buildkite repository settings to `git@github.com-pipeline-1:org/pipeline-1.git` and create the following SSH config file:

```
Host github.com-pipeline-1
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile /var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/id_rsa.pipeline-1
```

The following example shows how to create the corresponding pipeline-specific SSH key:

```bash
$ sudo su buildkite-agent # or whichever user your agent runs as
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "dev+build-pipeline-1@myorg.com"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/id_rsa): id_rsa.pipeline-1
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.pipeline-1.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pipeline-1.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
e4:60:69:a3:a0:63:bb:27:e6:ff:53:d3:4a:06:7f:e4 dev@org.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|                 |
|       .         |
|  .   * .        |
| . . = = .       |
|o.  . o S        |
|...    * E       |
| .    + +        |
| o.. . .         |
|oo+....          |
+-----------------+
$ ls
id_rsa.pipeline-1  id_rsa.pipeline-1.pub
```

## Using multiple keys with ssh-agent

If you need to use multiple keys, or want to use keys with pass-phrases, an alternative to the above hostname method is to use `ssh-agent`.

After running `ssh-agent` and adding the keys, you’ll need to ensure the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable is exported in your environment [agent hook](/docs/agent/hooks).

For example, if you set up `ssh-agent` like so:

```bash
$ sudo su buildkite-agent
$ ssh-agent -a ~/.ssh/ssh-agent.sock
$ export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/ssh-agent.sock
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa-pipeline-1
Identity added: /var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/id_rsa-pipeline-1
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa-pipeline-2
Identity added: /var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/id_rsa-pipeline-2
```

Then you will need the following environment [agent hook](/docs/agent/hooks) so that the build’s git operations use the `ssh-agent` socket:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -eu

export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/var/lib/buildkite-agent/.ssh/ssh-agent.sock"
```
