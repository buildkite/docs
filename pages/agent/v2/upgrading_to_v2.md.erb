The Buildkite Agent has changed a lot in v2 but upgrade process is straight forward. We'll cover what's changed and how to upgrade to new agents.

{:toc}

## What's changed

* The default install location has changed from `~/.buildbox` to `~/.buildkite-agent` (although each installer may install in different locations).
* Agents can be configured with [a config file](configuration).
* Agents register themselves with a organization-wide token, you no longer need to create them using the web.
* Agents now have [hooks support](hooks) and there should be no reason to customize the `bootstrap.sh` file.
* There is built-in support for containerizing builds with [Docker and Docker Compose](/docs/tutorials/docker-containerized-builds).
* There are [installer packages](installation) available for most systems.
* Agents now have [meta-data](agent-meta-data).
* Agent meta-data can be imported from EC2 tags with `--meta-data-ec2-tags`
* Build steps select agents using key/value patterns rather than explicit agent selection.
* Windows support
* Ability to specify commands such as `rake` and `make` in your build pipelines instead of a path to a script
* Automatic ssh fingerprint verification
* You can set a priority for the agent. `*priority 5` will have a job assigned to it over an agent with `*priority 4`
* The agent now works better under flakey internet connections by retrying certain API calls
* A new command `buildkite-agent artifact shasum` that allows you to download the shasum of a previously uploaded artifact

## Meta-data and agent targeting

No longer do you select individual agents to run build steps but instead you provide an agent query pattern that's used to select the correct agent.

See the [meta-data documentation](agent-meta-data) for more details.

## Bootstrap customizations

If you customized your `bootstrap.sh` file you should now switch to using hooks to achieve the same results. See our [hooks documentation](hooks) for details on the hooks available.

## Upgrading each pipeline

We recommend upgrading one pipeline at a time to the new agents. This is because you'll need to update your build pipelines to use agent targeting, rather than selecting the individual agents.

To update the agent on a build machine we recommend stopping the agent, removing all the files, and following the [install instructions for your platform](installation).

Once you have the new agent running, update your pipeline's build pipeline steps to target the new agent, and trigger a build.

## Upgrading a pre-1.0 agent

All agents prior to v2 (including the old Buildbox Ruby agents) are deprecated and will stop executing new jobs on December 12th 2015.

To upgrade, install the new 2.0 agent using the [standard installation methods](/docs/agent/v2/installation) and migrate each pipeline to target the new agents.

To make installation easier we've created packages for each of the major operating systems.

## Upgrading a 1.0 beta agent

To upgrade a _Ubuntu / Debian_ 1.0 beta agent:

* Edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/buildkite-agent.list` and replace the word `unstable` (or `experimental`) with `stable`
* Run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y buildkite-agent`

To upgrade a _Red Hat / CentOS_ 1.0 beta agent:

* Edit `/etc/yum.repos.d/buildkite-agent.repo` and replace the word `unstable` (or `experimental`) with `stable`
* Run `sudo yum clean expire-cache && sudo yum update buildkite-agent`

Note that when you install the agent on a new machine using the Debian / rpm packages the agent will be installed and run as the unprivileged `buildkite-agent` user, unlike some beta builds which ran as root.

If you didn't install the agent using the above packages then update the agent like you did originally and you should get the latest stable version.
