In cases where a Buildkite Agent is being deployed into a sensitive environment there are a few default settings and techniques which may be adjusted.

## Securely storing secrets

For best practices and recommendations about secret storage in the Agent, see the [Managing Secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) guide.

## Disabling automatic SSH fingerprint verification

By default the agent will auto-verify the SSH host using `ssh-keyscan` when doing the first checkout on a new agent host. Once you disable this functionality you'll need to manually perform your first checkout, or ensure the SSH fingerprint of your source code host is already present on your build machine.

Automatic SSH fingerprint verification can be disabled by setting `no-automatic-ssh-fingerprint-verification` in one of the following ways:

* Environment variable: `BUILDKITE_NO_AUTOMATIC_SSH_FINGERPRINT_VERIFICATION=1`
* Command line flag: `--no-automatic-ssh-fingerprint-verification`
* Configuration setting: `no-automatic-ssh-fingerprint-verification=true`

## Disabling command eval

By default the agent allows you to run any command on the build server (for example, `make test`). You can disable command evaluation and allow only the execution of scripts (with no ability to pass command line flags). Once disabled your build steps will need to be checked into your repository as scripts, and the only way to pass arguments is using environment variables.

To disable command line evaluation use one of the following settings:

* Environment variable: `BUILDKITE_NO_COMMAND_EVAL=1`
* Command line flag: `--no-command-eval`
* Configuration setting: `no-command-eval=true`

Note: hooks and plugins (Buildkite Agent 3.x) can override this setting. See [Allowing](#allowing) and [Custom bootstrap scripts](#customizing-the-bootstrap) for examples of how to completely lock down your agent from arbitrary code execution.

## Allowing

You can use the [agent's environment hook](hooks) to allow repositories, commands, plugins (for the Buildkite Agent 3.x beta), or any other logic you wish. The environment hook will be run before any source code is checked out onto the machine.

For example, the following environment hook allows only a single file from a single repository to be executed on the agent machine:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

if [[ "${BUILDKITE_REPO}" != "git@server:repo.git" ]]; then
  echo "Repository not allowed: ${BUILDKITE_REPO}"
  exit 1
fi

if [[ "${BUILDKITE_COMMAND}" != "some-script.sh" ]]; then
  echo "Command not allowed: ${BUILDKITE_COMMAND}"
  exit 1
fi

if [[ "${BUILDKITE_PLUGINS:-}" != "" ]]; then
  echo "Plugins not allowed: ${BUILDKITE_PLUGINS}"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Customizing the bootstrap

The Buildkite Agent comes with a default bootstrap script, but can be [configured](/docs/agent/v2/configuration) to run your own. Providing your own bootstrap provides the highest level of security and control of your agent machine. You can use it to customize your agent, sanitize command output, and implement your own security logic.

The Buildkite Agent is separated into a daemon executable and a bootstrap executable. The daemon is responsible for communicating with the Buildkite API and executing the bootstrap. The bootstrap is responsible checking out source code, calling hooks, running commands, and uploading build artifacts. The bootstrap is passed environment variables by the daemon process, and has its output streams and exit status captured.

For example, the following custom bootstrap will print out the environment variables passed by the main agent process, print a hello world, and exit with a failure status:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

env

echo "Hello world"

exit 1
```

## Forcing clean checkouts

By default Buildkite will reuse (after cleaning) a previous checkout. This may not be safe if building commits from untrusted sources (for example, 3rd party pull requests). To force a clean checkout every time, set `BUILDKITE_CLEAN_CHECKOUT=true` in the environment.

## Disallowing hooks in the repository

The default bootstrap script will execute hooks from the agent configuration (global) and the repository (local). Running local hooks may be undesirable if you are building commits from untrusted sources (for example, 3rd party pull requests).

Local hooks can be disabled by setting `BUILDKITE_NO_LOCAL_HOOKS=true` in the environment.

If local hooks are disabled and one is in the checkout, the job will fail.

NOTE: If building untrusted commits, you should also contain the build scripts and anything else that may be influenced by the repository contents within chroots, containers, VMs, etc as is appropriate for your needs.
