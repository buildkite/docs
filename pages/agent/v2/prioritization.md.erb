By setting an agent's priority value you are able to designate which priority it gets for being assigned build jobs to run. Higher priority agents are assigned work first, with the last priority being given to agents with the default value of `null`.

To set an agent's priority you can set it in the configuration file:

```
priority=9
```

or with the `--priority` command line flag:

```
buildkite-agent start --priority 9
```

or with the `BUILDKITE_PRIORITY` an environment variable:

```
env BUILDKITE_PRIORITY=9 buildkite-agent start
```
