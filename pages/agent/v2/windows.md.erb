## Installation

<%= render_agent_setup :windows %>

## SSH Key Configuration

SSH keys should be copied to (or generated into) in the userâ€™s `.ssh` directory. For example, typing the following into Git Bash will generate a new private key which you can add to your source code host:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "build@myorg.com"
```

See the [Agent SSH Keys](/docs/agent/ssh-keys) documentation for more details.

## Configuration

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/agent/configuration) for an explanation of each configuration setting.
