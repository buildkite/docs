## Installation

<%= render_agent_setup :osx %>

## SSH Key Configuration

SSH keys should be copied to (or generated into) the `.ssh` directory in the usersâ€™s home directory (i.e. `/Users/some-user/.ssh`). For example, to generate a new private key which you can add to your source code host:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "build@myorg.com"
```

See the [Agent SSH Keys](/docs/agent/ssh-keys) documentation for more details.

## File Locations

Homebrew install file locations:

* Configuration: `/usr/local/etc/buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg`
* Hooks: `/usr/local/etc/buildkite-agent/hooks`
* Builds: `/usr/local/var/buildkite-agent/builds`
* Log: `/usr/local/var/log/buildkite-agent.log`

Linux installer script file locations:

* Configuration: `~/.buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg`
* Hooks: `~/.buildkite-agent/hooks`
* Builds: `~/.buildkite-agent/builds`

## Configuration

See the [configuration documentation](/docs/agent/configuration) for an explanation of each configuration setting.

## Starting on Login

If you installed the agent using Homebrew you can run the following command to get instructions on how to install the correct plist and have buildkite-agent start on login:

```bash
brew info buildkite-agent
```

If you installed the buildkite-agent using the [Linux install script](linux) then you'll need to install the plist yourself using the following commands:

```bash
# Download the launchd config to /Library/LaunchDaemons/
curl -o ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.buildkite.buildkite-agent.plist https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildkite/agent/master/templates/launchd_local_with_gui.plist

# Set buildkite-agent to be run as the current user (a full user, created via System Prefs)
sed -i '' "s/your-build-user/$(whoami)/g" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.buildkite.buildkite-agent.plist

# Create the agent's log directory with the correct permissions
mkdir -p ~/.buildkite-agent/log && sudo chmod 775 ~/.buildkite-agent/log

# Start the agent
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.buildkite.buildkite-agent.plist

# Check the logs
tail -f ~/.buildkite-agent/log/buildkite-agent.log
```

## Upgrading

If you installed the agent using Homebrew you can use the standard brew upgrade command to update the agent:

```shell
brew update && brew upgrade buildkite-agent
```

If you installed the buildkite-agent using the [Linux install script](linux) then you should simply run the installer script again and it will update your agent.
