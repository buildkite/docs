The Buildkite Agent runs on your own machine, whether it's a VPS, server, desktop computer, embedded device. There are installers for:

Alternatively you can install it manually using the instructions below.

## Manual Installation

If you need to install the agent on a system not listed above you'll need to perform a manual installation using one of the binaries from [buildkite-agent’s releases page](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/releases).

Once you have a binary you simply create a bin and builds directory in `~/.buildkite-agent` and copy the binary and `bootstrap.sh` file into place:

```bash
mkdir ~/.buildkite-agent ~/.buildkite-agent/bin ~/.buildkite-agent/builds
cp buildkite-agent ~/.buildkite-agent/bin
cp bootstrap.sh ~/.buildkite-agent/bootstrap.sh
```

You should now be able to start the agent:

```bash
buildkite-agent start --help
```

If your architecture isn’t on the releases page send an email to support and we’ll help you out, our check out the [buildkite-agent’s readme](https://github.com/buildkite/agent#readme) for instructions on how to compile it yourself.
