## Installation

Alternatively you can follow the [manual installation instructions](installation).

## SSH Key Configuration

SSH keys should be copied to (or generated into) `~/.ssh/` for the user the agent is running as. For example, to generate a new private key which you can add to your source code host:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "build@myorg.com"
```

See the [Agent SSH Keys](/docs/agent/ssh-keys) documentation for more details.
