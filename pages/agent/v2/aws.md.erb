# Running Buildkite Agent on AWS

The Buildkite Agent can be run easily on AWS using our Elastic CI Stack for AWS.

<%= toc %>

## Install the Agent on your own AWS instance

To run the agent on your own AWS instances use whichever installer matches your
instance type. For Amazon Linux use the RH/CentOS installer.

## Use our pre-built Elastic CI Stack for AWS

The [Elastic CI Stack for AWS][github] is a pre-built CloudFormtion template
that gives you an autoscaling Buildkite Agent cluster in your own AWS. The
stack includes Docker, S3 and CloudWatch integration, and is suitable for
parallelizing large legacy test suites, testing any Linux-based project that can run within Docker, and performing AWS ops related tasks.

[Read the documentation][github] on GitHub, and launch it easily using the
button on your organizationâ€™s Agents page.
