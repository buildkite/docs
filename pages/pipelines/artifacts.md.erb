# Using Build Artifacts

In this guide we’ll walk through using the Buildkite Agent’s [artifact support](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact) to store and retrieve files between different steps in a build pipeline.

## Uploading Artifacts

To automatically upload artifacts created by a build step, set the `artifact_paths` attribute on your command step. In this example, any artifacts that are created in the `logs` or `coverage` directories, as well as any of their subdirectories, will be uploaded automatically: 

```yaml
steps:
  - label: ":hammer: Tests"
    command:
      - "npm install"
      - "tests.sh"
    artifact_paths:
      - "logs/**/*"
      - "coverage/**/*"
```

If you've defined your pipeline in Buildkite, you can set this field on a command step using the “Automatic Artifact Uploading” option:

<%= image 'artifact_pattern.png', size: '390x125', alt: 'Artifact pattern configuration' %> 

Defining a pattern here will cause your agents to automatically upload any artifacts that match your file path pattern. 

You can also perform an artifact upload manually in your build scripts by using
the `buildkite-agent artifact` command. In this example, the file `build.tar.gz` from the `pkg` directory will be uploaded to the default destination: 

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact upload pkg/build.tar.gz
```

You can then download the artifact in subsequent build steps (even if the build step is running on a different build server).

For full documentation of the `buildkite-agent artifact upload` command, and examples of supported glob patterns, see the [buildkite-agent artifact upload documentation](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact#uploading-artifacts).

## Downloading Artifacts

You can download artifacts created by a build job using the `buildkite-agent artifact download` command. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download pkg/build.tar.gz pkg/
```

If an artifact was previously uploaded at `pkg/build.tar.gz`, the above command will download it to the `pkg` directory.

The `buildkite-agent artifact` command will find the last file uploaded with the matching filename, no matter which build step uploaded it. If you want to target an artifact from a particular build step use the `--step` argument. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download build.zip tmp/ --step build
```

This will download the `build.zip` file from the pipeline step with the label "build".

For full documentation and examples, see the [buildkite-agent artifact download documentation](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact#downloading-artifacts).

## Downloading Artifacts Outside a Running Build

The `buildkite-agent artifact download` command only works within the context of a running build.

If you want to download an artifact from outside a build use our [Artifact Download API](/docs/api/artifacts#download-an-artifact).

## Further documentation

See the [Buildkite Agent artifact documentation](/docs/agent/v3/cli-artifact) for a full list of options and details of Buildkite’s artifact support.
