Customer security is paramount to Buildkite, where our source code, build artifacts and deployment processes represent some of our most valuable and sensitive assets.

The shift from a [self-hosted](/docs/pipelines/architecture#self-hosted-hybrid-architecture) to a [Buildkite hosted](/docs/pipelines/architecture#buildkite-hosted-architecture) architecture for Buildkite Agents, introduces the potential for new attack vectors and shared responsibility models, and hence, additional security considerations.

The security model for Buildkite hosted agents has the following characteristics to address these security considerations and to mitigate attack risks.

- **Infrastructure and isolation security**: Buildkite employs a multi-tenant architecture, where each job runs in a completely isolated virtualized environment. Once a job is complete, regardless of its exit status, the virtualized environment is destroyed, along with all its data (except for [cache volumes](/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents/cache-volumes) that persist across jobs). This ephemeral approach ensures that customer workloads remain isolated from each other, even though the underlying hardware is shared across multiple customers. For macOS hosted agents, virtualization is achieved through Apple's Virtualization framework on Apple Silicon, providing lightweight but secure virtual machine isolation.
