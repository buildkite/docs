# Manage rules

This page provides details on how to manage [rules](/docs/pipelines/rules) within your Buildkite organization.

## Create a rule

New rules can be created by [Buildkite organization administrators](/docs/team-management/permissions#manage-teams-and-permissions-organization-level-permissions) using the [**Rules** page](#create-a-rule-using-the-buildkite-interface), as well as the [REST API's](#create-a-rule-using-the-rest-api) or [GraphQL API's](#create-a-rule-using-the-graphql-api) create a rule feature.

### Using the Buildkite interface

To create a new rule using the Buildkite interface:

1. Select **Settings** in the global navigation to access the [**Organization Settings**](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/settings) page.

1. In the **Pipelines** section, select **Rules** > **New Rule** to open its page.

1. Under **Rule Type**, select the [type of rule](/docs/pipelines/rules#rule-types) to be created, that is, either **pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline** or **pipeline.artifacts_read.pipeline**.

1. Under **Rule Document**, specify the relevant values (either a pipeline UUID or a pipeline slug) for both the `source_pipeline` and `target_pipeline` pipelines, of your [**pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline**](/docs/pipelines/rules#rule-types-pipeline-dot-trigger-build-dot-pipeline) or [**pipeline.artifacts_read.pipeline**](/docs/pipelines/rules#rule-types-pipeline-dot-artifacts-read-dot-pipeline) rule. You can find the UUID values for these pipelines on the pipelines' respective **Settings** page under the **GraphQL API integration** section.

1. Select **Submit**.

    The rule is created and presented on the **Rules** page, with a description of the rule type and the relationship between both pipelines.

### Using the REST API

To [create a new rule](/docs/apis/rest-api/rules#rules-create-a-rule) using the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api), run the following example `curl` command:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -X POST "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rule": "pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline",
    "value": {
      "source_pipeline": "{pipeline-uuid-or-slug}",
      "target_pipeline": "{pipeline-uuid-or-slug}"
    }
  }'
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'apis/descriptions/rest_access_token' %>

<%= render_markdown partial: 'apis/descriptions/rest_org_slug' %>

- `rule` is the [type of rule](/docs/pipelines/rules#rule-types) to be created, that is, either `pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline` or `pipeline.artifacts_read.pipeline`.

- `source_pipeline` and `target_pipeline` accept either a pipeline slug or UUID.

- Pipeline UUID values for `source_pipeline` and `target_pipeline` can be obtained:

    * From the **Pipeline Settings** page of the appropriate pipeline. To do this:
        1. Select **Pipelines** (in the global navigation) > the specific pipeline > **Settings**.
        1. Once on the **Pipeline Settings** page, copy the `UUID` value from the **GraphQL API Integration** section

    * By running the [List pipelines](/docs/apis/rest-api/pipelines#list-pipelines) REST API query to obtain this value from `id` in the response from the specific pipeline. For example:

        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
          - X GET "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/pipelines"
        ```

### Using the GraphQL API

To [create a new rule](/docs/apis/graphql/cookbooks/rules#create-a-rule) using the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql-api), run the following example mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  ruleCreate(input: {
    organizationId: "organization-id",
    type: "pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline",
    value: "{\"source_pipeline\":\"pipeline-uuid-or-slug\",\"target_pipeline\":\"pipeline-uuid-or-slug\"}"
  }) {
     rule {
      id
      type
      targetType
      sourceType
      source {
          ... on Pipeline {
            uuid
          }
        }
      target {
        ... on Pipeline {
          uuid
        }
      }
      effect
      action
      createdBy {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'apis/descriptions/graphql_organization_id' %>

- `type` is the [type of rule](/docs/pipelines/rules#rule-types) to be created, that is, either `pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline` or `pipeline.artifacts_read.pipeline`.

- `source_pipeline` and `target_pipeline` accept either a pipeline slug or UUID.

- Pipeline UUID values for `source_pipeline` and `target_pipeline` can be obtained:

    * From the **Pipeline Settings** page of the appropriate pipeline. To do this:
        1. Select **Pipelines** (in the global navigation) > the specific pipeline > **Settings**.
        1. Once on the **Pipeline Settings** page, copy the `UUID` value from the **GraphQL API Integration** section

    * By running the `getCurrentUsersOrgs` GraphQL API query to obtain the organization slugs for the current user's accessible organizations, then [getOrgPipelines](/docs/apis/graphql/schemas/query/organization) query to obtain the pipeline's `uuid` in the response. For example:

        Step 1. Run `getCurrentUsersOrgs` to obtain the organization slug values in the response for the current user's accessible organizations:

        ```graphql
        query getCurrentUsersOrgs {
          viewer {
            organizations {
              edges {
                node {
                  name
                  slug
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        Step 2. Run `getOrgPipelines` with the appropriate slug value above to obtain this organization's `uuid` in the response:

        ```graphql
        query getOrgPipelines {
          organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
            pipelines(first: 100) {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  uuid
                  name
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

## Delete a rule

Rules can be deleted by [Buildkite organization administrators](/docs/team-management/permissions#manage-teams-and-permissions-organization-level-permissions) using the [**Rules** page](#delete-a-rule-using-the-buildkite-interface), as well as the [REST API's](#delete-a-rule-using-the-rest-api) or [GraphQL API's](#delete-a-rule-using-the-graphql-api) delete a rule feature.

### Using the Buildkite interface

To delete a rule using the Buildkite interface:

1. Select **Settings** in the global navigation to access the [**Organization Settings**](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/settings) page.

1. In the **Pipelines** section, select **Rules** to access its page.

1. Expand the existing rule to be deleted.

1. Select the **Delete** button to delete this rule.

### Using the REST API

To [delete a rule](/docs/apis/rest-api/rules#rules-delete-a-rule) using the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api), run the following example `curl` command:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -X DELETE "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/rules/{rule.uuid}"
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'apis/descriptions/rest_access_token' %>

<%= render_markdown partial: 'apis/descriptions/rest_org_slug' %>

- `{rule.uuid}` can be obtained:

    * From the **Rules** section of your **Organization Settings** page, accessed by selecting **Settings** in the global navigation of your organization in Buildkite.

    * By running a [List rules](/docs/apis/rest-api/rules#rules-list-rules) REST API query to obtain the rule's `uuid` in the response. For example:

        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
          - X GET "https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/{org.slug}/rules"
        ```

        **Important:** For the rule identified by its `uuid` in the response, ensure the pipeline UUIDs of the source (`source_uuid`) and target (`target_uuid`), as well as the rule type (`type`) match those of this rule to be deleted.

### Using the GraphQL API

To [delete a rule](/docs/apis/graphql/cookbooks/rules#delete-a-rule) using the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql-api), run the following example mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  ruleDelete(input: {
    organizationId: "organization-id",
    id: "rule-id"
  }) {
    deletedRuleId
  }
}
```

where:

<%= render_markdown partial: 'apis/descriptions/graphql_organization_id' %>

- `id` is the rule ID value, which can be obtained:

    * From the **Rules** section of your **Organization Settings** page, accessed by selecting **Settings** in the global navigation of your organization in Buildkite.

    * By running a [List rules](/docs/apis/graphql/cookbooks/rules#list-rules) GraphQL API query to obtain the rule's `id` in the response. For example:

        ```graphql
        query getRules {
          organization(slug: "organization-slug") {
            rules(first: 10) {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  type
                  source {
                    ... on Pipeline {
                      slug
                    }
                  }
                  target {
                    ... on Pipeline {
                      slug
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        **Important:** For the rule identified by its `uuid` in the response, ensure the pipeline UUIDs of the source (`source_uuid`) and target (`target_uuid`), as well as the rule type (`type`) match those of this rule to be deleted.
