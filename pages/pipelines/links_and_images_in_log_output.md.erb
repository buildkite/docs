# Links & Images in Log Output

You can embed links, external images, and images generated by your builds directly into your logs using special ANSI escape codes.

ANSI escape codes are used for many tasks in UNIX terminals, such as setting text color uses an ANSI escape code. Buildkite supports most standard ANSI escape codes and a few special ones, thanks to our terminal output processor, [`terminal-to-html`](https://github.com/buildkite/terminal-to-html).

## Links

You can embed clickable links to Buildkite or other web pages by using ANSI escape code `1339`.

The following Bash function takes a URL and optional link text and will output the correct escape code sequence:

```bash
function inline_link {
  LINK=$(printf "url='%s'" "$1")

  if [ $# -gt 1 ]; then
    LINK=$(printf "$LINK;content='%s'" "$2")
  fi

  printf '\033]1339;%s\a\n' "$LINK"
}
```

You can use it like so:

```bash
inline_link 'https://buildkite.com/'
```

Or, to use a custom label:

```bash
inline_link 'https://buildkite.com/' 'Buildkite'
```

You can also link to an uploaded artifact by using the `artifact://` URL syntax:

```bash
inline_link 'artifact://tmp/images/omg.gif'
```

## Images

### Syntax for Inlining Images

The syntax for inlining images uses ANSI escape code `1338`. A `url` is required, and you can optionally specify an `alt` attribute to describe what the image is.

The following Bash function takes an image URL and alternative text and will output the correct escape code sequence:

```bash
function inline_image {
  printf '\033]1338;url='"$1"';alt='"$2"'\a\n'
}
```

You can use it like so:

```bash
inline_image 'https://media0.giphy.com/media/8Ry7iAVwKBQpG/giphy.gif' 'Rainbows'
```

When rendered in Buildkite (via our open-source [Terminal tool](http://buildkite.github.io/terminal-to-html/)) it will look like this:

<%= image("external_image.png", size: '598x410') %>

When you run the script locally you won't see any output because your terminal will ignore the escape code. If you pipe your build script to `more` you can see the raw escape codes.

### Inlining Build Artifact Images

You can inline artifact images by using the `artifact://` URL syntax. For example you can inline the following artifact:

<%= image("artifact_path.png", size: '228x140') %>

by using the following URL:

```bash
inline_image 'artifact://tmp/images/omg.gif' 'OMG'
```

Be careful to ensure the part of the URL after `artifact://` exactly matches the path you see in the Artifacts tab (e.g. it can't have a preceding `./`).

The image artifact does not have to be uploaded at the time it’s written to the build log. If the artifact has not been uploaded you'll see a loading placeholder, and as soon as it's ready the image will automatically appear.

### Library Support

* The [capybara-inline-screenshot](https://github.com/buildkite/capybara-inline-screenshot) Ruby gem will automatically inline screenshots of your integration test failures and also supports the iTerm image format for viewing failures directly in your terminal. When run under CI it automatically uses the `artifact://` URL format.

<%= image("ruby_gem.png", size: '806x387') %>

### Base64 Encoded Images

If you want to embed an image using base64 you can use [iTerm’s image format](http://iterm2.com/images.html#/section/home), though you’ll need to keep in mind the [log output limits](/docs/pipelines/managing-log-output#log-output-limits). Where possible we recommend not using this format, but instead uploading the image as a build artifact and referencing it using the `artifact://` URL.
