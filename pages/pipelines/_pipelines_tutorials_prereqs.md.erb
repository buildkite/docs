To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Buildkite account. If you don't have one already, <a href="<%= buildkite_url.signup_path %>">create a free personal account</a>.

    If you're signing up to Buildkite and need to create a new Buildkite organization, you'll initially be guided through a flow to create a starter pipeline.

    As part of this flow, upon reaching the **Create your first pipeline** page, select **Create starter pipeline**, and on the next **Choose your agent setup** page, select **Skip agent setup**, since you'll be doing these steps as part of this tutorial.

- To enable the YAML steps editor in Buildkite. If you haven't already done this:
    1. Select **Settings** > **YAML Migration** to open the [**Pipeline YAML Migration**](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/pipeline-migration) page.
    1. Select **Use YAML Steps for New Pipelines**, then confirm the action in the dialog.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This tutorial uses GitHub, but Buildkite can work with any version control system by adapting the relevant steps below to those for your particular Git-based setup.
