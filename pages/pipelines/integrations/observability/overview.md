# Observability overview

Buildkite Pipelines generates detailed events about your pipelines, builds, jobs, and agents. Observability integrations let you export this data to the monitoring tools your team already uses, so you can watch CI performance alongside the rest of your infrastructure.

You can stream events to Amazon EventBridge, emit metrics and traces to Datadog or Honeycomb, or adopt the OpenTelemetry integration for vendor-neutral pipelines observability. Community plugins provide additional targets and custom dashboards. Follow the guides below to set up and explore each of these observability options.
