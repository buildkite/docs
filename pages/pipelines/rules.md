# Rules overview

_Rules_ is a Buildkite feature that can do the following:

## Rule types

Buildkite Pipelines supports two types of rules that allow one pipeline build to:

- [Trigger another pipeline build](#rule-types-pipeline-dot-trigger-build-dot-pipeline).
- [Read the artifacts generated by another pipeline build](#rule-types-pipeline-dot-artifacts-read-dot-pipeline).

### pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline

This rule type allows one pipeline to trigger another, where:

- Both pipelines are in the same or different [clusters](/docs/clusters/overview).
- One pipeline is public and another is private.

**Note:** This rule type overrides the usual [trigger step permissions checks](/docs/pipelines/trigger-step#permissions) on users and teams.

**Rule Document** format:

```json
{
  "rule": "pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline",
  "value": {
    "source_pipeline_uuid": "pipeline-uuid",
    "target_pipeline_uuid": "pipeline-uuid"
  }
}
```

where:

- `source_pipeline_uuid` is the UUID of the pipeline that's allowed to trigger another pipeline.
- `target_pipeline_uuid` is the UUID of the pipeline that can be triggered by the `source_pipeline_uuid` pipeline.

Learn more about creating rules in [Manage rules](/docs/pipelines/rules/manage).

#### Example use case: cross-cluster pipeline triggering

Clusters may be used to separate the environments necessary for building and deploying an application. For example, a continuous integration (CI) pipeline has been set up in cluster A and likewise, a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline in cluster B. Ordinarily, pipelines in separate clusters are not able to trigger builds between each other due to the strict isolation of clusters.

However, a `pipeline.trigger_build.pipeline` rule would allow a trigger step in the CI pipeline of cluster A to target the CD pipeline in cluster B. Such rules would allow deployment to be triggered upon a successful CI build, while still maintaining the separation between the CI and CD agents in their respective clusters.

### pipeline.artifacts_read.pipeline

This rule type allows one pipeline to access (that is, with read-only permissions) the artifacts built by another, where:

- Both pipelines are in the same or different [clusters](/docs/clusters/overview).
- One pipeline is public and another is private.

**Rule Document** format:

```json
{
  "rule": "pipeline.artifacts_read.pipeline",
  "value": {
    "source_pipeline_uuid": "pipeline-uuid",
    "target_pipeline_uuid": "pipeline-uuid"
  }
}
```

where:

- `source_pipeline_uuid` is the UUID of the pipeline that's allowed to access the artifacts from another pipeline.
- `target_pipeline_uuid` is the UUID of the pipeline whose artifacts can be accessed by jobs in the `source_pipeline_uuid` pipeline.

#### Example use case: sharing assets between clusters

Artifacts are not accessible between pipelines across different clusters. For example, a deployment pipeline in cluster B cannot ordinarily access artifacts uploaded by a CI pipeline in cluster A.

However, a `pipeline.artifacts_read.pipeline` rule can be used to override this restriction. For example, assets uploaded as artifacts by the CI pipeline would now be accessible to the deployment pipeline via the `buildkite-agent artifact download --build xxx` command.
