# Privilege Isolation in Buildkite

The recommended architecture for creating a shared agent pool capable of running Buildkite jobs with elevated IAM privileges consists of two main components:
1. Pipeline to IAM role mapping
2. Agent able to run a job isolated to that role

This approach to handling privilege isolation in Buildkite can be described using the following diagram:

## Pipeline to IAM role mapping

Pipeline to IAM role mapping can be stored anywhere where it's suitable. We recommend using a repository in your
[GitHub Enterprise](/docs/integrations/github-enterprise) instance with strict permissions and pull request settings (for example, when a merge requires at least two approvals). This allows allows engineers to learn by example, ensure permission changes are reviewed and audited, and fits well with an infrastructure-as-code
approach.

Example role-mapping syntax:

```
$ ls configs/*
configs/example-pipeline-1-slug.yml
configs/example-pipeline-2-slug.yml
$ cat configs/example-pipeline-1-slug.yml
role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example-pipeline-1-role"
```

### Adding a new role for a given pipeline

For pipeline authors to escalate their pipeline’s permissions above the default
CI permissions, it would be necessary to open a pull request on this repository associating the
assumed IAM role with the pipeline.

Once merged, it's then becomes possible to retry their failing scripts or create a new build.

## Agent setup with privilege isolation

The pool of available Buildkite agents can use the standard approach of having a
base AMI, autoscaling group, Buildkite agent metrics poller, and persistent Buildkite agent that starts on instance boot.v

By default, jobs run without elevated permissions and are secured using Docker with Sysbox as the container runtime. Aside from the standard dependencies, the base AMI would have:

* [Sysbox](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox)
* Custom agent bootstrap
* iptables rules disabling AWS IMDS access from the docker0 network interface

### Sysbox

Sysbox is an open-source `runc` compatible container runtime that allows the use of Docker and Docker Compose within it, without needing to run insider Docker-in-Docker configurations. The sysbox team is available for Enterprise support, security reviews, custom development, etc.

The custom agent bootstrap is a wrapper around the standard agent bootstrap, that
runs each job within a Docker container using sysbox.

It's tested to work with RHEL, but does require a relatively recent Linux kernel.

### Custom agent bootstrap

When the Buildkite agent accepts a job it spawns a subprocess called the bootstrap
passing the required information as environment variables.

By default, the Buildkite agent is configured to run buildkite-agent bootstrap as the bootstrap,
but it can be configured to call another executable, and is often wrapped or replaced for different environments.
To implement per-pipeline IAM roles it's recommended to create a custom bootstrap
(usually a shell script), and configure the agent to use it.

To configure your Buildkite agent to use the custom agent bootstrap:

* Read the pipeline slug from `the BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_SLUG` env
* Refresh the main branch checkout of the Pipelines to IAM role mapping repository
* Download a pipeline slug-specific SSH key or default SSH key (from secrets manager or similar, based
on path conventions), to mount into the container
* `mkdir -p` a pipeline slug specific build directory to mount into the container (this allows subsequent
jobs for that pipeline on the agent to have a warm git checkout)
* Create temporary role credentials using `aws sts assume-role`
* Run the job in a sysbox system container, passing in mounts, and all required environment variables.

You can use either:

    * Your own Docker image, with the `buildkite-agent` installed so you can execute
`buildkite-agent bootstrap`. You can also add your own
custom agent hooks or standard dependencies/tools.

    * The standard [buildkite/agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildkite/agent/) Docker image. This uses `buildkite-agent` as the default `ENTRYPOINT`, so you can `docker run buildkite/agent bootstrap`.

*The `buildkite-agent bootstrap` inside the container will then handle all standard behaviour, checking
out the commit into the build dir, plugins, etc. but executing under the assumed IAM role.
