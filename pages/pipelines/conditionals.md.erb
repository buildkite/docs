# Using Conditionals

Using conditionals, you can run builds or steps only when specific conditions are met. Define [boolean conditions using C-like expressions](#variable-and-syntax-reference).

You can define conditionals at the step level in your `pipeline.yml` or at the pipeline level in your Buildkite version control provider settings.

## Conditionals in pipelines

<!--alex ignore master-->

You can have complete control over when to trigger pipeline builds by using conditional expressions to filter incoming webhooks. You need to define conditionals in the _Pipeline Settings page_ for your repository provider to run builds only when expressions evaluate to `true`. For example, to run only when a pull request is targeting the master branch:

<%= image "conditionals.png", width: 864, height: 298, alt: "Conditional Filtering settings" %>

Pipeline-level build conditionals are evaluated before any other build trigger settings. If both a conditional and a branch filter are present, both filters must pass for a build to be created â€“ first the pipeline-level limiting filter and then the conditional filter.

Conditionals are supported in [Bitbucket](/docs/integrations/bitbucket), [Bitbucket Server](/docs/integrations/bitbucket-server), [GitHub](/docs/integrations/github), [GitHub Enterprise](/docs/integrations/github-enterprise), and [GitLab](/docs/integrations/gitlab) (including GitLab Community and GitLab Enterprise). You can add a conditional on your _Pipeline Settings page_ in the Buildkite UI or using the REST API.

>ðŸ“˜ Evaluating conditionals
> Conditional expressions are evaluated at pipeline upload, not at step runtime.

## Conditionals in steps

Use the `if` attribute in your step definition to conditionally run a step.

In the below example, the `tests` step will only be run if the build message does not contain the string "skip tests".

```yml
steps:
	- command: ./scripts/tests.sh
	  label: tests
	  if: build.message !~ /skip tests/
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

The `if` attribute can be used in any type of step, and with any of the supported expressions and parameters. However, it cannot be used at the same time as the `branches` attribute.

Be careful when defining conditionals within YAML. Many symbols have special meaning in YAML and will change the type of a value. You can avoid this by quoting your conditional as a string.

```yml
steps:
	- command: ./scripts/tests.sh
	  label: tests
	  if: "!build.pull_request.draft"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Multi-line conditionals can be added with the `|` character, and avoid the need for quotes:

```yml
steps:
    - command: ./scripts/tests.sh
      label: tests
      if: |
      	// Don't when the message contains "skip tests"
      	// Only run on feature branches
        build.message !~ /skip tests/ &&
          build.branch =~ /^feature\//
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

Since `if` conditions are evaluated at the time of the pipeline upload, it's not possible to use the `if` attribute to conditionally run a step based on the result of another step.

To run a step based on the result of another step, upload a new pipeline based on the `if` condition set up in the [command step](/docs/pipelines/command-step) like in the example below:

```yml
steps:
  - label: "Validation check"
    command: ./scripts/validation_tests.sh
    key: "validation-check"
  - label: "Run regression only if validation check is passed"
    depends_on: "validation-check"
    command: |
      if [ $$(buildkite-agent step get "outcome" --step "validation-check") == "passed" ]; then
         cat <<- YAML | buildkite-agent pipeline upload
         steps:
           - label: "Run Regression"
             command: ./scripts/regression_tests.sh
      YAML
      fi
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

## Conditional notifications

To trigger [Build notifications](/docs/pipelines/notifications#conditional-notifications) only under certain conditions, use  the same `if` syntax as in your [Steps](/docs/pipelines/conditionals#conditionals-in-steps).

For example, the following email notification will only be triggered if the build passes:

```yaml
notify:
  - email: "dev@acmeinc.com"
    if: build.state == "passed"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

## Conditionals and the broken state

Jobs become `broken` when their configuration prevents them from running. This might be because their [branch configuration](/docs/pipelines/branch-configuration) doesn't match the build's branch, or because a conditional returned `false`. This is distinct from `skipped` jobs, which might happen if a newer build is started and build skipping is enabled. A rough explanation is that jobs break because of something _inside_ the build and are skipped by something _outside_ the build.

## Variable and syntax reference

Evaluate expressions made up of [boolean operators](#variable-and-syntax-reference-operator-syntax) and [variables](#variable-and-syntax-reference-variables).

### Operator syntax

The following expressions are supported by the `if` attribute.

 <table>
 	<tbody>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Comparators</td>
 			<td><code>== != =~ !~</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Logical operators</td>
 			<td><code>|| &&</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Array operators</td>
 			<td><code>includes</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Integers</td>
 			<td><code>12345</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Strings</td>
 			<td><code>'feature-branch' "feature-branch"</code></td>
 		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Literals</td>
 			<td><code>true false null</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Parentheses</td>
 			<td><code>( )</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Regular expressions</td>
 			<td><code>/^v1\.0/</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Prefixes</td>
 			<td><code>!</code></td>
 		</tr>
 		<tr>
 			<td>Comments</td>
 			<td><code>// This is a comment</code></td>
 		</tr>
 	</tbody>
 </table>

>ðŸš§ Formatting regular expressions
> When using regular expressions in conditionals, the regular expression must be on the right hand side, and the use of the <code>$</code> anchor symbol must be escaped to avoid <a href="/docs/agent/v3/cli-pipeline#environment-variable-substitution">environment variable substitution</a>. For example, to match branches ending in <code>"/feature"</code> the conditional statement would be <code>build.branch =~ /\/feature$$/</code>.

### Variables

The following variables are supported by the `if` attribute. Note that you cannot use [Build Meta-data](/docs/pipelines/build-meta-data) in conditional expressions.

>ðŸš§ Unverified commits
> Note that GitHub accepts <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification">unsigned commits</a>, including information about the commit author and passes them along to webhooks, so you should not rely on these for authentication unless you are confident that all of your commits are trusted.

## Example expressions

To run only when the branch is `master` or `production`:

```js
build.branch == "master" || build.branch == "production"
```

To run only when the branch is not `production`:

```js
build.branch != "production"
```

To run only when the branch starts with `features/`:

```js
build.branch =~ /^features\//
```

To run only when the branch ends with `/release-123`, such as `feature/release-123`:

```js
build.branch =~ /\/release-123\$/
```

To run only when building a tag:

```js
build.tag != null
```

To run only when building a tag beginning with a `v` and ends with a `.0`, such as `v1.0`:

```js
// Using the tag variable
build.tag =~ /^v[0-9]+\.0\$/

// Using the env function
build.env("BUILDKITE_TAG") =~ /^v[0-9]+\.0\$/
```

To run only if the message doesn't contain `[skip tests]`, case insensitive:

```js
build.message !~ /\[skip tests\]/i
```

To run only if the build was created from a schedule:

```js
build.source == "schedule"
```

To run when the value of `CUSTOM_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` is `value`:

```js
build.env("CUSTOM_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE") == "value"
```

To run when the **[unverified](#unverified-commits)** build creator is in the `deploy` team:

```js
build.creator.teams includes "deploy"
```

To run only non-draft pull requests:

```js
!build.pull_request.draft
```
