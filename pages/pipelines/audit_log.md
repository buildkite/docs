# Audit log

Audit Log is an interactive track record of all organization activity. This feature is only available to Buildkite customers on the [Enterprise](https://buildkite.com/pricing) plan, and can be found in Organization Settings in the Audit section.

Audit Log contains two tabs:

* **Events** - where you see all the events that take place within your Buildkite organization.
