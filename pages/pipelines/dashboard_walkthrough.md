# Dashboard walkthrough

Once you've set up a few pipelines and have run some builds, you can see an overview of them on the dashboard. Each pipeline has a set of metrics to give you an overview of its health and performance.

## Pipeline status

A visual indication of your pipeline's current status. This icon is based on the latest build on your default branch.

<%= image "build-status.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the pipeline status icon" %>

## Build history

The build history visualizes the last 30 builds that have been run on your default branch. The height of each bar reflects the build's running time, and its status is represented by its colour and in the tooltip on hover.

<%= image "graphs.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the build history visualization" %>

## Speed

The speed of your pipeline is calculated from the average of your 30 most recent builds. This helps you keep an eye on your pipeline's speed, and compare performance between pipelines.

## Reliability

The reliability of your pipeline is a calculation based on passing vs failing builds over the last 30 days. This metric helps you to understand the overall stability of your pipelines.

## Builds per week

The builds per week measurement is calculated based on the average number of builds created over the past 4 weeks. This metric helps you to understand how frequently a pipeline is run.

## Bookmarking pipelines

You can keep your most used pipelines at the top of the page by hovering over a pipeline, and clicking the bookmark icon on the right.

## Filtering pipelines

You can filter pipelines using the search bar at the top of the page. This will search the titles of pipelines, and return all those matching your search terms.

<%= image "filtering-pipelines.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the filtering text input field" %>

You can add tags to your pipelines and use them to quickly filter pipelines using the search bar. You can manage a pipelineâ€™s tags in the _Pipelines Settings_ section.

If your organization has Teams enabled, you can also filter this page by the teams that you're in. When you have more than one team attached to your Buildkite account, you'll see a dropdown list of teams at the top of the dashboard. This defaults to 'All Teams'. Selecting a specific team will filter the list of pipelines to display only those accessible by the selected team.

## Customizing the page

You're able to edit a pipeline's:
- name
- description
- emoji
- color
- repository
- default branch

After you've clicked on a pipeline, the settings button is in the top right corner.

<%= image "settings.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the pipelines settings button" %>

The display settings can be found in the _Pipeline Settings_ section. Adding a description, emoji, and color for your pipeline is optional, but name, repository, and default branch are all required.

The emoji and color will replace the icon on the dashboard. Descriptions also have full emoji support. ðŸ™Œ

## Pipeline page

Clicking through to a pipeline page shows the [build history](#build-history) for that pipeline, your starred branches, and the ten most recently built branches for that pipeline.

<%= image "pipelines-detail.png", width: 2048/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Screenshot of the pipelines settings page" %>

You can filter a pipelineâ€™s builds by branch, build state, or your own builds using the Filter menu.

<%= image "filtering-builds.png", width: 2608/2, height: 1244/2, alt: "Screenshot of the builds filter menu" %>

To see the steps for a build, click the Show steps button on the right of any build.

<%= image "showing-build-steps.png", width: 2408/2, height: 520/2, alt: "Screenshot of toggling build steps" %>

## Build page

Clicking through to a build page shows the full list of jobs and other steps in that build, the information about who triggered the build, and the controls for rebuilding or cancelling the build while it's in progress.

On the build page, you can also _Edit Steps_ in the current build, open _Pipeline Settings_, or start a _New Build_.

<%= image "inside-build-page.png", width: 2028/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Inside the build page" %>

Each job in a build has a footer that displays the job exit status, which provides more visibility into the outcome of each job. It helps you to diagnose failed builds by finding issues with agents and pipelines.

Job exit status may include the exit signal reason, which indicates whether the Buildkite agent stopped or the job was cancelled.

<%= image "exit-status.png", width: 2048/2, height: 880/2, alt: "Exit status of a job" %>

If you want to access the exit status through an API, it's only available in the [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql-api).
