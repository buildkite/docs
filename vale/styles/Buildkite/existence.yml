# This style suggests alternatives where the case on the left and right side of the swap may not matter.

# Use this style to:
# - Suggest alternatives where the case doesn't matter on either side of the swap (e.g., whitelist → allowlist, Whitelist → Allowlist)
# - Explain case-sensitive spelling hints when a word has one and only one valid case (e.g., oauth → OAuth)
