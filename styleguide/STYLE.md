# Styleguide
Welcome to the Buildkite styleguide. These are the guidelines we use to write the docs.
If something isn't included in this guide, see the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

## Language
This section covers everything related to the language and formatting used in Buildkite documentation (and website, to some extent).

### Dictionary
We use American English, so our first-call dictionary is [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). It is not a single source of truth, just a good starting/reference point.
We also use [Vale](https://github.com/apps/vale-linter) and our own [linter](https://github.com/buildkite/docs#linting) with a file that contains our own [custom list of words](https://github.com/buildkite/docs/blob/main/vale/vocab.txt) that may confuse the spellchecker.

### English flavor
Again, we use American English. We're also a highly multi-national team, so here is the list of the most notable [differences between American, British, and Australian English](http://linktranslation.com.au/the-differences-between-american-british-and-australian-english/) English to watch out for.

### Commas
Keep it clean and uncluttered. If the sentence can live without that comma - leave it out.

### Serial commas
Absolutely yes, yes, and yes.

### Active/passive voice

Generally, use active voice. It's usually clearer and simpler.

### Gender
Always use ‘they’, never use ‘he’ or ‘she’.
More info on writing about pronouns and in the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/grammar/nouns-pronouns).

### Talking about YAML

* Attributes not parameters. For example, "Add the `notify` attribute".
* When discussing nesting/indenting, first attributes (attributes not nested under any other are "top level".

## Style and formatting
This section covers the matters that go beyond language and provides guidelines for consistency and a unified look.

### Consistency
Keep your writing consistent with itself and other docs. This means abbreviations, capitalization, hyphens, names of UI elements, etc.

### Title capitalisation

Use Title case in H1 page headings `# Heading`:
*"The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog."*
Also known as headline style and capital case. All words capitalized, except for certain subsets defined by rules that are not universally standardized, often minor words such as "the" (as above), "of", or "and". The standardization is only at the level of house styles and individual style manuals. (See Headings and publication titles.) A simplified variant is start case, where all words, including articles, prepositions, and conjunctions, start with a capital letter.

Use Sentence case in section headings (`## Heading`,`### Heading`, `#### Heading`, etc.):
*"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."*
The standard case used in English prose. Generally equivalent to the baseline universal standard of formal English orthography mentioned above; that is, only the first word is capitalized, except for proper nouns and other words which are generally capitalized by a more specific rule.

When in doubt, consult [Title.sh](https://title.sh/) for proper capitalization according to the The Chicago Manual of Style.

More info [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization#By_name_of_style).

### Capital letters in proper names
Only capitalize the name of the product - e.g. 'GitHub organization' and not 'GitHub Organization'.

### Capital letters in UX elements
Use title capitalization for names of tabs and buttons in the Buildkite interface - e.g. 'Personal Settings', 'Repository Providers', 'Save Organization Settings'.

### Bullet lists

Capitalize the first word; no full stops at the end if it’s only one sentence. If there are two or more sentences in the list element, the final one will have a full stop.

See also what Microsoft has to say on [lists](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/lists).

### Writing numbers
Write out numbers up to 10, then use digits - '58 bugs in this script and just two hours to fix them all!'
Long numbers use commas to separate thousands - '100,000,000.00'. When in doubt, look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/numbers).

Do not use numbers in page headings. Only use numbers less than 10 in section headings.
No restrictions on using numbers in the body of the text.


### Referring to UI elements

UI elements should be italic. For example:

To get your agent token, navigate to *Agents*, then select *Reveal Agent Token*.


### Time and date

Use 24hr time with hours and minutes, but not seconds. Include timezone. e.g. 17:00 AEST

More in [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/date-time-terms).

### Spacing after full stops
**Question:** Should you use one or two spaces after end punctuation?
**Answer:** One space.

A little [historical background](https://www.onlinegrammar.com.au/the-grammar-factor-spacing-after-end-punctuation-capitals/) on why this is even a valid question.
P.S. Remember that, ironically enough, in Markdown, line breaks demand exactly two blank spaces at the end of the line.

### Common trip-ups
Linters cannot do all of the work for you, so please pay attention to the following cases:

* **Their/they’re/there, your/you’re** - [check](https://www.dictionary.com/e/their-there-theyre/ ) if you’ve got the right one for your situation!
* **Affect/effect** - affect is a verb, effect is a noun. When you affect something, you’re impacting or changing the thing. When you have an effect, it’s the outcome or result of a change.
* Be mindful of **hyphens**! Hyphens for compound adjectives, no hyphens in verbs: 'end-user documentation' vs. 'for the end user'.

### Headings
No multi-sentence headings or full stops at the end of a sentence in page or sentence headings.
Be consistent about heading levels - H1, H2, H3 - no jumping from H1 to H3 or H2 to H4.

## Code and filenames
This section deals with adding and properly formatting code in the documentation + naming files, pages, and their derivative URLs.

### Code formatting
We use the GitHub flavor of markdown for [formatting code](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code).

For code or file names as a part of a sentence, use "\`\" before and after the word(s) that need(s) to be marked as code: Each command step can run either a shell command like `npm install`, or an executable file or script like `build.sh`.
In markdown this sentence looks like this: " Each command step can run either a shell command like \`npm install\`, or an executable file or script like \`build.sh\`. "

Do not use code fragments in page headings or section headings.

### Code blocks
A code example longer than a couple of words that isn’t part of a sentence/a multi-line code sample needs to be formatted as a code block according to the [GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code).
To add a code block, indent it using four (4) spaces or use 3 backticks (\`\`\`) before and after the code block.

```
Hello, world!
```

To add a filename to a codeblock, immediately after the block use `{: codeblock-file="filename.extension"}` (for example, `{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}`).

To add syntax highlighting, you can use [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/), for example:
```
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello world"```
```
turns into
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello world"
```
You can see the full list of supported languages and lexers [here](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers)

This probably goes without saying, but do not use code fragments in page headings or section headings.

## Working with the docs site

Our docs website is a custom build. This section gives some guidance on working with the setup.

### Adding and naming new documentation pages
To add a new documentation page, create it as a *.md.erb file. Give it a lowercase name, separate words using underscores.
To add the new page to the documentation sidebar on https://buildkite.com/docs, add the corresponding entry to
`app/views/layouts/_sidebar.html.erb` with a description (e.g. `"G Cloud Identity", 'integrations/sso/g-cloud-identity'` ).
> **Note:** Ruby, which keeps the website running, interprets underscores in filenames as hyphens. So if a page is called `octopussy_cat.erb.md`, you need to add it as `octopussy-cat` to the `application.html.erb` file.

### Escaping vale linting

If you absolutely need to add some word that triggers the linter, you can use escaping via the following syntax:

```
<!-- vale off -->

This is some text that you do NOT want the linter to check

<!-- vale on -->
```
Use the `vale off` syntax before a phrase that needs to be bypassed by the linter and don't forget to turn it on again with `vale on`.

### Links

Use standard markdown links for both internal and external links.

Internal links need to start with `/docs`, for example:

```
Read more about [environment variables](/docs/pipelines/environment-variables)
```

### Anchor links  

To use an anchor link where you need to link to an H2-level heading, append the section's name to the main page link, for example:  
`/docs/pipelines/secrets` will contain `/docs/pipelines/secrets#using-a-secrets-storage-service`.

If you need to create a link to an H3-level heading, start with an H2-level anchor link. Such links are generated automatically from the section title, and are viewable in the # that appears when you mouse over the heading. Add a `-` to the H2-level anchor link, and append the full name of the H3-level title to it. The result will be a long link. For example:  
`/docs/pipelines/environment-variables#environment-variable-precedence-job-environment` 
Here the H2-level link for "\#\# Environment variable precedence" is `/docs/pipelines/environment-variables#environment-variable-precedence` and the H3-level link for "\#\#\# Job environment"is appended as `-job-environment`.  

### Content reuse

Add snippets to the directory where they'll be used, prefaced with an underscore. For example `_my_snippet.md.erb`. **However**, when pulling the snippet into a file, remove the leading underscore.

So

`/integrations/_step_2_3_github_custom_status.md.erb`

Becomes

`<%= render_markdown 'integrations/step_2_3_github_custom_status' %>`  

### Custom elements
We have a few custom scripts for adding useful elements that are missing in Markdown.

#### Table of contents
To generate a table of contents from all your \##\-level headings, use `{:toc}`.
>Note: Make sure there are no spaces after the `{:toc}` - spaces immediately after this custom element are known to break the script.

#### Docs Note

Use the following example to add a 'note' in the documentation.

```
<section class="Docs__note">
  <h3>Setting agent defaults</h3>
  <p>Use a top-level <code>agents</code> block to <a href="/docs/pipelines/defining-steps#step-defaults">set defaults</a> for all steps in a pipeline.</p>
</section>
```

#### Docs Troubleshooting Note
Use the following example to add a 'troubleshooting note' in the documentation.

```<section class="Docs__troubleshooting-note">
  <p class="Docs__note__heading">Running each build in it’s own container</p>
  <p>This page references the out-of-date Buildkite Agent v2.</p>
  <p>For docs referencing the Buildkite Agent v3, <a href="/docs/agent/v3/cli_artifact">see the latest version of this document</a>.
</section>
```

## Screenshots
This information was aggregated by going over the existing screenshots in the documentation repo. Feel free to change or expand it.

### Taking and processing screenshots
* **Format:** PNG
* **Ratio:** arbitrary, but **strictly even number of pixels** for both height and width
* **Size:** the largest possible resolution that makes sense. It's preferable that you take the screenshots on a Mac laptop with a Retina screen. (add division by 2 when publishing if the image is very large, e.g. `width: 2280/2, height: 998/2`).
* **Border:** no border
* **Drop shadow:** no
* **Cursor:** include when relevant
* **Area highlight selection:** rectangular, no shadow, color either red `#FC2A1C` or blue `#96C3F1` (currently undecided)
* **Blur:** use to obscure sensitive info like passwords or real email addresses; even, non-pixelated
* **User info:** blur out everything except for the name
* **Dummy data:** use Acme Inc as dummy company title
* **Naming screenshots:** lowercase, words separated by hyphens; number after the title, e.g. "installation-1"

### Adding screenshots or other images

> Before you proceed, make sure that both the width and the height of the image are an even number of pixels!

Steps for adding add an image to a documentation page:
1. Name the image file (lowercase, separate words using hyphens; add a number to the filename, e.g. 'installation-1' if you are adding several images to the same page)
2. Put the file into the corresponding `images` folder (a folder with the same name as the page you are adding this image to; create such folder if it doesn't exist yet)
3. Compose relevant alt text for the image file using Title case
4. Add your image file to the documentation page using the following code example `<%= image "your-image.png", width: 1110, height: 1110, alt: "Screenshot of Important Feature" %>`.
For large images/screenshots taken on a retina screen, use `<%= image "your-image.png", width: 1110/2, height: 1110/2, alt: "Screenshot of Important Feature" %>`.
